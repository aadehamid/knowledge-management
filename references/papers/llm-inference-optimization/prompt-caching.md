As I write this post, cached input tokens are 10x cheaper
in dollars per token than regular input tokens for both OpenAI and Anthropic's
APIs.

[Anthropic even claim](https://claude.com/blog/prompt-caching) that prompt caching can reduce latency **"by up to 85%
for long prompts"** and in my own testing I found that for a long enough prompt,
this is true. I sent hundreds of requests to both Anthropic and OpenAI and
noticed a substantial reduction in time-to-first-token latency for prompts where
every input token was cached.

Now that I've hooked you in with fancy gradient text and pretty charts, have you ever asked yourself...

What on earth is a cached token?

What's going on in those vast oceans of GPUs that enables providers to give you
a 10x discount on input tokens? What are they saving between requests? It's not
a case of saving the response and re-using it if the same prompt is sent again,
it's easy to verify that this isn't happening through the API. Write a prompt,
send it a dozen times, notice that you get different responses each time even
when the `usage` section shows cached input tokens.

Not satisfied with the answers in the [vendor](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching) [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-caching), which do a
good job of explaining *how* to use prompt caching but sidestep the question of
*what* is actually being cached, I decided to go deeper. I went down the rabbit
hole of how LLMs work until I understood the precise data providers cache, what
it's used for, and how it makes everything faster and cheaper for everyone.

### By the end of this post you will...

* Understand, at a deeper level, how LLMs work
* Have built some new intuition for why LLMs work the way they do
* Understand the exact 1s and 0s that get cached, and how they reduce the cost of your LLM requests

## LLM Architecture

At their core, LLMs are giant mathematical functions. They take a sequence of
numbers as input, and produce a number as output. Inside the LLM there is an
enormous graph of billions of carefully arranged operations that transform the
input numbers into an output number.

This enormous graph of operations can be roughly split into 4 parts.

LLM architecture diagramTokenizerAttentionFeedforwardTransformerEmbeddingOutput

Each node in that diagram can be thought of as a function that takes some
input, and produces some output. Input is fed into the LLM in a loop until a
special output value tells it to stop. Here's how it might look as pseudocode:

Copy code

```
1prompt = "What is the meaning of life?";2 3tokens = tokenizer(prompt);4while (true) {⋯5	embeddings = embed(tokens);6	for ([attention, feedforward] of transformers) {⋯7		embeddings = attention(embeddings);8		embeddings = feedforward(embeddings);9	}10	output_token = output(embeddings);11	if (output_token === END_TOKEN) {⋯12		break;13	}14	tokens.push(output_token);15}16 17print(decode(tokens));
```

### LLMs are surprisingly small

While the above is *greatly* simplified, it surprised me
just how few lines of code modern LLMs have.

[Sebastian Raschka](https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/) creates
standalone reimplementations of open source models using PyTorch, as well as
a tonne of other top-tier educational material that you'll enjoy if you like
this post. One of the current leading open models, Olmo 3, comes in
at [only a couple hundred lines of
code](https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch/blob/main/ch05/13_olmo3/standalone-olmo3.ipynb)
for example.

The place where prompt caching happens is in the "attention" mechanism of the
transformer. We're going to walk through how an LLM works, in
order, until we get there. That means we have to start this journey by talking
about tokens.

## Tokenizer

LLM architecture diagramTokenizerAttentionFeedforwardTransformerEmbeddingOutput

Before the LLM can do anything with your prompt, it needs to convert it into a
representation it can work with. This is a two-step process shared between the
tokenizer and the embedding stages. It won't become
clear *why* this is all necessary until we get to embedding, so
bear with me while we go through *what* the tokenizer does.

The tokenizer takes your prompt, chops it up into small chunks, and
assigns each unique chunk an integer ID called a "token." For example, here's
how GPT-5 tokenizes the prompt "Check out [ngrok.ai](https://ngrok.ai/)":

4383

```
Check
```

842

```
 out
```

1657

```
 ng
```

17690

```
rok
```

75584

```
.ai
```

The prompt has been split into the array `["Check", " out", " ng", "rok", ".ai"]`, and converted into the tokens `[4383, 842, 1657, 17690, 75584]`. The
same prompt always results in the same tokens. Tokens are also case-sensitive,
and this is because capitalisation tells you something about the word. "Will"
with a capital W is more likely to be a name than "will" with a lowercase W, for
example.

### Why not just split on spaces? Or characters?

This is a surprisingly big question, and covering it in detail could easily
double the length of this post. The short, unsatisfying answer is that it's a
trade-off. If you want to go deep on it [Andrej Karpathy has an excellent
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zduSFxRajkE) where he builds a
tokenizer from scratch. For prompt caching, it's enough to know that
tokenization turns text into numbers.

Tokens are the fundamental unit of input and output for LLMs. When you ask
ChatGPT a question, the response is streamed back to you one token at a time as
each iteration of the LLM is completed. Providers do this because generating a
full response can take tens of seconds, but sending you each token when it's
ready makes the process *feel* more interactive.

Let's ask a classic LLM question to see this in action. Hit the
send button below when you're ready.

Input (12 tokens)

How[5299,

␣many1991,

␣r428,

's885,

␣in306,

␣word2195,

'?127222,

217,

␣or503,

␣something3543,

␣id1211,

k74,

<end>199999]

Output

How many r's in the word 'strawberry'?

Prompt tokens go in, ✨ AI happens ✨, output token comes out, repeat. This
process is called "inference," and notice that every output token gets appended
to the input prompt before the next iteration. LLMs need all of the context to
produce good answers. If we only fed the prompt in, it would continually try to
produce the first token of the answer. If we only fed the answer in, it would
immediately forget the question. The whole prompt + the answer need to be fed
into the LLM, every single iteration.

### What's that 199999 <END> token all about?

Inference has to stop at some point. LLMs have a variety of "special" tokens
they can output, one of which signals the end of a response. In the GPT-5
tokenizer this is token `199999`. This is one of many ways LLMs can terminate.
You could specify a maximum number of tokens to generate through the API, and
providers may also have other safety-related rules about when to stop.There are also special tokens for denoting the start and end of conversational
messages, and these are how chat models like ChatGPT and Claude know when one
message ends and another begins.

Last thing on tokenizers: there are lots of them! The tokenizer
that ChatGPT uses is different to the one Claude uses. Even different models
made by OpenAI use different tokenizers. Each tokenizer has its own rules for
splitting text into tokens. If you want to see how a variety of different
tokenizers split text, check out
[tiktokenizer](https://tiktokenizer.vercel.app/).

Now that I've introduced you to tokens, let's talk about
embeddings.

## Embedding

LLM architecture diagramTokenizerAttentionFeedforwardTransformerEmbeddingOutput

Our tokens from the tokenizer are now fed into the
embedding stage. To understand embedding, it helps to understand
what the **goal** of a model is.

When humans solve a problem with code, we write functions that take input and
produce output. Converting Fahrenheit to Celsius, for example.

Copy code

```
1function fahrenheitToCelsius(fahrenheit) {⋯2	return ((fahrenheit - 32) * 5) / 9;3}
```

We can throw any number into `fahrenheitToCelsius` and get the right answer. But
what if we had a problem where we *didn't* know the formula? What if we just had
this mysterious table of inputs and outputs below?

| Input | Output |
| --- | --- |
| 21 | 73 |
| 2 | 3 |
| 10 | 29 |
| 206 | 1277 |

I'm not expecting you to recognise the function here, though I will say that
ChatGPT figures it out straight away if you paste a screenshot into the app.

When we know the expected output for each input, but not the function that
produces it, we can "train" a model to learn the function. We do this by giving
the model a canvas—the enormous graph of mathematical operations—and
modifying that graph until the model converges on the correct function. Every
time the graph is updated, we run the inputs through it to see how close it gets
to the correct outputs. We do this until we're happy it's close enough. This is
what training is.

It turns out, when training a model to output correct text, it helps to be able
to recognise when two sentences are similar. Similar how, though? They may be
similarly sad, or funny, or thought-provoking. They may be similar in length,
rhythm, tone, language, vocabulary, structure. There are a huge number of
**dimensions** that we can use to describe the similarity of two sentences, and
sentences can be similar along some dimensions but not others.

Tokens do not have dimensions. They're plain ol' integers.
Embeddings, though, embeddings have lots of dimensions.

An embedding is an array of length `n` representing a position in
`n`-dimensional space. If `n` were 3, an embedding might be `[10, 4, 2]`
representing the location `x=10, y=4, z=2` in 3 dimensional space. When LLMs are
being trained, each token gets assigned a random starting location in this
space, and the training process nudges all of the tokens around until it finds
an arrangement that produces the best outputs.

The embedding stage starts out by looking up each token's
embedding. In pseudocode it might look like this:

Copy code

```
1// Created during training, never changes during inference.2const EMBEDDINGS = [...];3 4function embed(tokens) {5	return tokens.map(token => {6		return EMBEDDINGS[token];7	});8}
```

So we take `tokens`, an array of integers, and convert it into an array of
embeddings. An array of arrays, or a "matrix." Toggle between
tokens and embeddings below to see how I picture this
process in my head.

The tokens `[75, 305, 284, 887]` get converted into a matrix of 3-dimensional
embeddings.

The more dimensions we give the embeddings, the more dimensions it has to
compare sentences with. We've been talking about embeddings with 3 dimensions,
but current models have embeddings with thousands of dimensions. The biggest
ones have more than 10,000.

To demonstrate the value of more dimensions, below I have 8 groups of coloured
shapes that start off in 1-dimensional space. They sit on a line, and they're a
jumbled mess that's hard to make sense of. But as you add more dimensions, it
becomes clear that there are 8 distinct, related groups. Click the **2D** and **3D**
buttons to see what I mean.

3 dimensions is the best I can do for a visual example here, you'll have to use
your imagination to picture what you might be able to do with thousands of
dimensions.

There's one last thing that the embedding stage does. After
fetching a token's embeddings, it encodes the token's *position within the
prompt* into the embeddings. I didn't dig deeply into how this works other than
enough to know it doesn't make much difference to how prompt caching works, but
without it the LLM would not be able to tell the order of the tokens in the
prompt.

To update our pseudocode from earlier, assume that a function called
`encodePosition` exists. It takes embeddings and a position and returns new
embeddings with the position encoded within.

Copy code

```
1const EMBEDDINGS = [...];2 3// Input: array of tokens (integers)4function embed(tokens) {5	// Output: array of n-dimensional embedding arrays6	return tokens.map((token, i) => {7		const embeddings = EMBEDDINGS[token];8		return encodePosition(embeddings, i);9	});10}
```

In summary, embeddings are points in `n`-dimensional space that you
can think of as the **semantic meaning** of the text they represent. During
training, each token gets moved within this space to be close to other, similar
tokens. The more dimensions, the more complex and nuanced the LLM's
representation of each token can be.

All of the work we've done in the tokenizer and
embedding stages has been to convert text into something the LLM
can work with. Let's now take a look at what that work looks like in the
transformer stage.

## Transformer

LLM architecture diagramTokenizerAttentionFeedforwardTransformerEmbeddingOutput

The transformer stage is all about taking embeddings
as input and moving them around their n-dimensional space. It does this in two
ways, and we're only going to focus on the first: **attention**. We aren't going
to talk about "Feedforward" or the output stage (in this post 👀).

The job of the attention mechanism is to help the LLM understand the
relationships between each token in the prompt, by allowing tokens to influence
each others' positions in n-dimensional space. It does this by combining the
embeddings of the prompt's tokens in a weighted fashion. The input is an entire
prompt's embeddings, and the output is a single new
embedding that is a weighted combination of all of the input
embeddings.

For example, if we had the prompt "Mary had a little", and it resulted in the 4
tokens `Mary`, `had`, `a`, and `little`, the attention mechanism might decide
that to generate the next token we should use:

* 63% of `Mary`'s embeddings
* 16% of `had`'s embeddings
* 12% of `a`'s embeddings
* 9% of `little`'s embeddings

And it would combine them all by scaling them by their weights and summing them
up. This is how LLMs know how much they should care about, or "attend" to, each
token in a prompt.

This is the most complicated and abstract part of the process so far. I'm going
to present it first as pseudocode, and then we'll have a look at how the
embeddings get manipulated passing through it. I wanted to make this section
less math-heavy but it's hard to avoid some math here. You can do it, I believe
in you.

Most of the calculations in attention are **matrix multiplications**. The only
thing you need to know about matrix multiplication for this post is that the
shape of the output matrix is determined by the shapes of the input matrices.
The output always has **the same number of rows as the first input matrix** and
the **same number of columns as the second input matrix**.

With that in mind, here's how a simplified attention mechanism calculates the
weight to assign to each token. In the code below I'm using `*` to represent
matrix multiplication.

Copy code

```
1// Similar to EMBEDDINGS from the pseudocode2// earlier, WQ and WK are learned during 3// training and do not change during inference.4// 5// These are both n*n matrices, where n is the6// number of embedding dimensions. In our example7// above, n = 3.8const WQ = [[...], [...], [...]];9const WK = [[...], [...], [...]];10 11// The input embeddings look like this:12// [13//   [-0.1, 0.1, -0.3], // Mary14//   [1.0, -0.5, -0.6], // had15//   [0.0, 0.8, 0.6],   // a16//   [0.5, -0.7, 1.0]   // little17// ]18function attentionWeights(embeddings) {19	const Q = embeddings * WQ;20	const K = embeddings * WK;21	const scores = Q * transpose(K);22	const masked = mask(scores);23	return softmax(masked);24}
```

Let's take a look at the embeddings as they flow through this function.

### Hold up, what're these WQ and WK variables?

Remember how I said earlier that the embeddings for each token get assigned a
random position and then the training process makes small tweaks to them until
the model converges on a good arrangement?`WQ` and `WK` are similar. They're `n`-by-`n` matrices, with `n` being the
embedding dimension, and they're given random values at the start of training.
Then during training they also get tweaked to help the model converge on a
good solution.Anything that gets tweaked during training is said to be a "model parameter."
Each floating point number in the embeddings vectors and inside these WQ and
WK matrices is one parameter. When you hear a model being described as having
"175 billion parameters," these are the numbers they're talking about.As for what `WQ` and `WK` *actually are*, we kinda don't know. As the model converges, they
end up representing some kind of transformation of the embeddings that helps
the model produce good output. They could be doing anything, and interpreting
what's in there is an open and active area of research.

To get `Q` and `K` we take `embeddings` and multiply them by `WQ` and `WK`
respectively. `WQ` and `WK` always have rows and columns equal to the number of
embedding dimensions, which is 3 in this case. I've picked random values for
`WQ` and `WK` here, and values are rounded to 2 decimal places for readability.

| -0.56 | -0.06 | 0.51 |

The resulting `Q` matrix has 4 rows and 3 columns. 4 rows because the embeddings
matrix had 4 rows (one per token), and 3 columns because `WQ` had 3 columns (one
per embedding dimension).

The calculation for `K` is exactly the same, just with `WK` instead of `WQ`.

`Q` and `K` are both "projections" of the input embeddings into new
n-dimensional spaces. They're not the original embeddings, but they're derived
from them.

Then we take `Q` and `K` and multiply them together. We "transpose" `K`, which
means we flip it along the diagonal, so that the resulting matrix is a square,
with rows and columns equal to the number of tokens in the input prompt.

| 0.36 | -0.33 | -0.04 | -1.53 |
| 0.26 | -0.15 | -0.09 | -1.08 |

These `scores` are a representation of how important each token is to the next
token generated. The top left number, `-0.08`, is how important "Mary" is to
"had". Then 1 row down, `-0.10`, is how important "Mary" is to "a". I'll show a
visual of this after the matrix math. Everything that happens next is about
turning these scores into weights that we can use to mix the
embeddings together.

The first problem with this matrix of `scores` is that it allows future tokens to influence the past. In that top row, the only word we know about is "Mary", so it should be the only word that contributes to the generation of "had". The same goes for the second row, where we know "Mary" and "had", so only those two words should contribute to the generation of "a", and so on.

To fix this, we apply a triangular mask to the matrix to zero out future tokens.
Rather than zero them out though, we set them to negative infinity. I'll explain
why in a moment.

The second problem is that these scores are arbitrary numbers. They would be
much more useful to us if they were a distribution that sums to 1 across each
row. This is exactly what the `softmax` function does. The details of how
`softmax` works aren't important, it's slightly more complicated than dividing
each number by the sum of the row, but the result is the same: each row sums to
1, and each number is between 0 and 1.

| 0.38 | 0.25 | 0.27 | 0.10 |

To explain the negative infinities, here's an implementation of `softmax` in code:

Copy code

```
1function softmax(matrix) {⋯2	return matrix.map(row => {⋯3		const exps = row.map(x => Math.exp(x));4		const sumExps = exps.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);5		return exps.map(exp => exp / sumExps);6	});7}
```

It doesn't quite sum the numbers and then divide each number by the sum.
Instead, it takes the `Math.exp` of each number first, which does `e^x`. If we
used zeroes instead of negative infinity, `Math.exp(0) === 1` so the zeroes
would still contribute a weight. `Math.exp(-Infinity)` is `0`, which is what we
want.

The grid below shows an example of the attention weights for the prompt "Mary
had a little". You can hover or click grid cells to see the contribution each
token has. These weights don't match up with the calculations above because I
pulled them from the version of GPT-2 that's running at the fantastic
[Transformer Explained](https://poloclub.github.io/transformer-explainer/) site.
So these are real weights from a real, albeit old, model.

In the first row, we just have "Mary", so Mary contributes 100% to "had". Then
in the 2nd row "Mary" contributes 79% while "had" contributes 21% to the
generation of "a", and so on. It's probably not surprising that the word the LLM
thinks is most important in this sentence is "Mary," as shown by Mary having the
highest weight in every row. If I asked you to complete the sentence "Jessica
had a little" it's unlikely you'd pick "lamb."

All that remains is to do the mixing of the token embeddings, which is
mercifully simpler than generating the weights.

Copy code

```
1// Learned during training, doesn't change 2// during inference. This is also an n*n matrix,3// where n is the number of embedding dimensions.4const WV = [[...], [...], ...];5 6function attention(embeddings) {7	const V = embeddings * WV;8	// This is the `attentionWeights` function from9	// the section above. We're wrapping it in10	// this `attention` function.11	const weights = attentionWeights(embeddings);12	return weights * V;13}
```

Similar to before, we have a `WV` matrix that's determined at training time. We
use this to get a `V` matrix from the token embeddings.

### Why not mix the embeddings directly?

When we derive `Q` and `K` then multiply them together to get the attention
weights, we're operating entirely on the *relevance* tokens have to each
other. Embeddings are encoding all sorts of semantic meaning about the tokens,
one dimension could represent "colour", another "size", another "rudeness",
and so on. The weights are using similarity to determine relevance.What `WV` allows the model to do is to then decide which dimensions to carry
forward. In the sentence "Mary had a little", what's important about Mary is
her name. The model could have also learned plenty about the drink Bloody
Mary, or Mary Queen of Scots. These are irrelevant to the nursery rhyme, and
it would introduce noise to carry them forward. So `WV` allows the model to
filter out irrelevant features before mixing the embeddings together.

Then we multiply that `V` by the `weights` we generated, and the output is a new set of embeddings:

A matrix with 4 rows 4 columns, labelled "weights".

| 0.02 | 0.13 | -0.22 |
| 0.20 | 0.16 | -0.14 |

The final output of the attention mechanism is the last row of this `output`
matrix. All of the contextual information from previous tokens has been mixed
into this last row through the attention process, but all of the previous rows
had to be calculated to do that.

So all in all, embeddings go in and a new embedding
comes out. The attention mechanism has done a lot of intricate math to mix
tokens together in proportion to how important they are based on the `WQ`, `WK`,
and `WV` matrices it learned during training. This is the mechanism that allows
LLMs to know what's important in its context window, and why.

We now, finally, know everything we need to know to talk about caching.

### There is more to attention

What I've shown here is a simplified (I know, right?) version of attention
designed to highlight what matters most for prompt caching. There's more to it
in practice, and if you're interested in going deeper I recommend the
[3blue1brown video on attention](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMlx5fFNoYc).

## Prompt caching

Let's take a look at the grid above again, but this time we'll see it get
populated as each new token is produced in the inference loop. Hit play to start
the animation.

Every new token is appended to the input and reprocessed in full. But look
closely, play the animation back a few times: none of previous weights change.
The 2nd row is always `0.79` and `0.21`. The 3rd row is always `0.81`, `0.13`,
`0.06`. *We're redoing lots of calculations we don't need to.* Most of the
matrix multiplications for "Mary had a little" aren't necessary if you've only
just finished processing "Mary had a", which is how the LLM inference loop
works.

You can avoid these duplicate calculations by making two changes to the
inference loop:

* Cache the `K` and `V` matrices every iteration.
* Only feed the newest token into the model, not the entire prompt.

Let's walk through the matrix multiplications again but this time, we have the
first 4 tokens' `K` and `V` matrices cached, and we only pass in a single
token's embeddings. Yes, it's more matrix math, I'm sorry, but it's mostly the
same as above and we're going to speed through it.

Calculating a new `Q` produces just a single row as output. `WQ` hasn't changed
from before.

likewise `WK` is the same.

So now we have the `K` matrix for all of the tokens in the prompt, but we've
only had to calculate the last row of it.

This single new row of embeddings is all that we needed. All of the contextual
information from previous tokens has been baked into it thanks to the cached `K`
and `V`.

The data that gets cached is the result of `embeddings * WK` and `embeddings * WV`, so `K` and `V`. As a result, prompt caching tends to be called "KV caching."

That's it, those `K` and `V` matrices above, they are the 1s and 0s that the
providers save in their giant datacenters to offer us 10x cheaper tokens, and
much faster responses.

Providers hold on to these matrices for each prompt for 5-10 minutes after the
request is made, and if you send a new request that starts with the same prompt,
they reuse the cached `K` and `V` rather than recalculating them. What's really
cool is that you can partially match a cache entry and still use the bit that
matched, not the whole thing.

The visual below round robins between a few prompts that have similar prefixes,
to show how cache entries might get used. Every so often the cache gets emptied
to show how it fills back up.

### Cache

No cached prompts yet.

OpenAI and Anthropic do caching very differently from each other. OpenAI do it
all automatically for you, attempting to route requests to cached entries when
possible. In my experiments, by sending a request and then immediately resending
it, I was able to get a hit rate of about 50%. Given how long the
time-to-first-byte can get for long context windows, this could lead to
inconsistent performance.

Anthropic give you more control, letting you decide when to cache and for how
long. You pay for this privilege, but in my experiments Anthropic route you to
cached entries 100% of the time when you ask them to cache a prompt. This might
make them a more appropriate choice for applications where you're operating on
long context windows and need predictable latency.

### Wait, what about temperature?

There are a variety of parameters that LLM providers offer you to control the
randomness of what a model will produce. Common ones are `temperature`,
`top_p`, and `top_k`. These parameters all affect the final step of the
inference loop, where the model picks a token based on the probabilities it
has assigned to each token in its vocabulary. This happens *after* the
attention mechanism has produced the final embeddings, so prompt caching is
unaffected by these parameters. You can change them freely without worrying
about invalidating your cached prompts.

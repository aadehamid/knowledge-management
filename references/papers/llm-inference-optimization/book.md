# Chapter 0: The Inference Engineer's World

I want to begin this book with a confession, because it is what started me writing it.

For the better part of the last two years I believed that the beauty of large language models lived inside *pre-training*. That was where the math was, that was where the physics was, that was where the late-night whiteboard sessions happened. Attention, optimizers, scaling laws, tokenization, loss curves that fall for six weeks at a time, those were the objects I thought deserved the love. I wrote a full **Build an LLM from Scratch** series with that conviction. Thousands of students worked through it with me. Every chapter was about training, because I assumed training was where the real art was.

I was wrong. Not about the math, the math in pre-training really is beautiful, but about where the larger share of the magic lives. The longer I spent running production AI products at Vizuara, the more I realized that the part I had been treating as a footnote, *inference*, is in fact the whole story of whether a product is usable, affordable, or even possible. Inference is where your one trained model meets the uncompromising physics of a single GPU, and then the uncompromising economics of a thousand users, and then the uncompromising politics of a shipping deadline. It turns out this meeting is not a footnote. It is the main event.

And it is beautiful. There is as much mathematics in inference as there is in training, it is just a different flavor of math, the kind that cares about bytes transferred, arithmetic intensity, cache hit rates, tail latencies, and the exact shape of a curve called the *roofline*. There is as much engineering intuition as there is theory, and there is a craft to stacking a dozen tricks on top of each other so that the whole stack behaves like one coherent machine. Opening the hood of a modern inference engine feels less like reading a paper and more like pulling the cowling off an aircraft engine: hundreds of tiny moving parts, each one doing a specific job, all of them timed against each other so the whole thing can move. A great inference system is closer to a beautifully assembled car or aircraft than to a single equation. Many parts, one motion.

This book is a pleasure for me to write precisely because I finally get to show how those parts align. We will take the reader from a single GPU doing one forward pass (where arithmetic intensity decides whether you are wasting 99 percent of your hardware) to a thousand GPUs across three continents (where routing, autoscaling and KV-cache-aware load balancing decide whether a user in Singapore ever sees a response). At every step I will write the way I talk when I am excited about something, slowly, with the math visible, and with the intuition named out loud.

Here is the one claim I am going to keep repeating, and that every chapter of this book will justify:

> **Inference engineering is the most consequential discipline in applied AI in 2026, and almost nobody understands it well.**

Read this chapter with one question open: *when every open-source model in the world is free to download, why does it still matter how it is served?* The rest of the book is the answer.

## Why This Discipline Exists

### 0.1: Meet Vizz AI: a live tutor that costs too much

At Vizuara we built **Vizz AI** (vizz.vizuara.ai), a personalized AI tutor that talks to students in real time. Not chat. Not typed prompts. A live, spoken conversation where the tutor adapts to the student, remembers the last few minutes of context, and responds with a natural voice.

Under the hood, Vizz AI runs on Google's **Gemini Live Stream API**. The pipeline is shown in Figure 0.1.

![Figure 0.1: Vizz AI pipeline](figures/ch00-fig1-viz-ai-pipeline/final.png)
*Figure 0.1.* Four stages: the student's voice hits Gemini's speech-to-text endpoint, the transcribed text enters our LLM + RAG + memory layer where reasoning happens, the response text is sent to Gemini's text-to-speech endpoint, and the audio streams back to the student. Every conversational turn re-bills the entire accumulated context.

The figure shows a four-stage horizontal flow. The first and last stages are Gemini APIs priced per token (audio in at $3.00 / 1M tokens, audio out at $12.00 / 1M). The middle stage, the LLM plus retrieval-augmented generation plus memory, is where **inference engineering actually lives**, and is the piece we want to own. Notice the horizontal band above the pipeline: *every turn is billed for the full accumulated context*, which means cost compounds the longer the conversation gets. A student 20 minutes into a session is paying for the context of minutes 1-through-19 on every new turn.

The system is genuinely good. Students love it. But a few weeks after launch, my developer walked into my office and said:

> *"Raj, this is not sustainable. The costs are piling up."*

Let us do the math on a single 30-minute tutoring session. Gemini Live charges per token across four streams, student voice in, tutor voice out, RAG context in, LLM reasoning out, and each conversational turn is billed **against the entire accumulated context so far**, not just the new tokens.

| Component | Rate | Per 30-min session |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Audio input (student's voice) | $3.00 / 1M tokens | $0.075 |
| Audio output (tutor's voice) | $12.00 / 1M tokens | $0.270 |
| Text input (RAG, memory) | $0.75 / 1M tokens | $0.150 |
| Context accumulation overhead | ~2× multiplier | $0.500 |
| **Total per session** |  | **~$1.00** |

One dollar per session sounds fine. At 10,000 daily active students it becomes **$10,000 per day**, up to $300,000 per month on the closed-source API. That is the *potential* bill, the upper bound of what a team pays when every request is routed through a closed-source API like Gemini or GPT-5. The crucial point is that this number is not fixed. Moving the same workload onto an open-source model that you host yourself does not shave a few dollars off it, it collapses it by more than an order of magnitude. Figure 0.2 makes the comparison concrete.

![Figure 0.2: Closed-source vs. open-source self-hosted cost](figures/ch00-fig2-viz-ai-cost-explosion/final.png)
*Figure 0.2.* Same product, same usage, two ways to serve it. The top row is the potential closed-source bill: $1 per session, $10,000 per day at 10,000 concurrent students, up to $300,000 per month. The bottom row is the same workload served on open-source weights hosted on our own GPUs: roughly $0.05 per session, $500 per day, ~$15,000 per month in GPU rental. The difference is not the model. It is the serving stack.

The three bars in Figure 0.2 are not a projection or a worst case; they are the simple multiplication of our real pricing by our real user count. The $1-per-session number looked sustainable until the first "x 10,000 students" multiplier landed. The $300,000-per-month number is what makes the problem unignorable. At this scale, self-hosting is not an optimization, it is survival. And Gemini, by policy, sees every sentence of every student's conversation. For an education company that cares about data sovereignty, that is unacceptable on its own.

The only sustainable move: **download an open-source model, host it ourselves, and serve it from our own GPUs**.

We do not need to train a model. Meta's Llama-3 is free. Google's Gemma is free. DeepSeek's weights are free. The challenge is not "can we get a model", the challenge is what happens after we download it. That is inference engineering, and the questions it must answer are unforgiving:

* **Time to first token (TTFT).** The tutor begins speaking within how many milliseconds of the student finishing? If it is 3 seconds, the conversation feels broken. We need under 300 ms.
* **Inter-token latency (ITL).** Once the voice begins, the tokens stream at what rate? Any stutter and the illusion collapses. We need under 30 ms per token.
* **Throughput.** 10,000 students online at the same time, each in their own private session. We need to absorb thousands of concurrent inference requests on the hardware we rent.

I ask my developer, *"How do we maximize all three metrics at once?"*

He says, *"Raj, it is not about the model. It is about how you serve the model. That is a different discipline."*

That discipline is the subject of this book. Vizz AI was our own wake-up call, and I expect you have a version of the same story inside whatever product you are trying to ship.

Before we leave this section, I want to address the one objection every engineer raises at this point: *"Sure, but open-source models are worse than closed-source ones, right? So you are only saving money by accepting lower quality?"* That objection was true in 2023. It was mostly true in 2024. By the Spring of 2026 it is simply not true any more, and Figure 0.3 is the single clearest picture of why. The quality gap between the best closed-source frontier (GPT-5, Claude Opus 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Pro) and the best open-source models (Llama 4, Qwen 3, DeepSeek V3) has shrunk from roughly twenty benchmark points in 2023 to about three in 2026. For all but the narrowest of frontier reasoning workloads, you can now pick an open-source model that is good enough, and the bottleneck moves to how you serve it.

![Figure 0.3: The rise of open-source models](figures/ch00-fig5-rise-of-open-source/final.png)
*Figure 0.3.* Left panel: the closing quality gap between closed-source frontier and best open-source models across 2023–2026. Right panel: the top open-source families of Spring 2026 by downloads on Hugging Face. Three of the top six are now Chinese-origin models (Qwen, DeepSeek, GLM), and Chinese-origin models account for roughly 41% of all Hugging Face downloads according to the *State of Open Source on Hugging Face, Spring 2026*. The point for an inference engineer is simple: when the model is free, the competitive advantage of a product moves entirely into the serving stack. That is why inference engineering, as a field, has exploded in the last eighteen months.

### 0.2: Meet DynaRoute: why every query should not hit the same model

A second Vizuara product: **DynaRoute** (dynaroute.vizuara.ai). DynaRoute asks a provocative question that most companies refuse to ask:

> **Why should every query go to the same LLM?**

A student asking *"What is 2 + 2?"* does not need GPT-5. A student asking *"Derive the Navier-Stokes equations from first principles"* does not belong on a 1B-parameter model. Today, almost every enterprise deployment of AI routes every query, easy, medium, hard, to the most powerful model available. The bill is enormous, and most of it is wasted on trivial queries.

DynaRoute inserts an **intent classifier** in front of the model pool. The architecture is shown in Figure 0.3.

![Figure 0.3: DynaRoute intent classifier](figures/ch00-fig3-dynaroute-intent-classifier/final.png)
*Figure 0.3.* Every incoming query first hits a tiny, fast classifier (~20 ms latency) that labels it easy, medium, or hard. The classifier routes to one of three Llama models of increasing size: 1B, 8B, or 70B. Each model has its own per-token price.

In Figure 0.3, the classifier is deliberately drawn as prominent as the three downstream models. That is because, in practice, the classifier has to hit a much tighter latency target than any of the models it routes to. If the classifier takes 500 ms to decide where a query goes, we have added half a second to every request before inference even starts, and for an "easy" query that the 1B model could have answered in 200 ms, we have undone the whole point. So the classifier is itself a production inference system: small model, aggressive quantization, served on the same stack with the same metrics we are going to learn to optimize.

If 70% of queries are classifiable as easy, 20% as medium, and 10% as hard, the economics transform. Figure 0.4 shows the per-million-query comparison.

![Figure 0.4: DynaRoute 86% savings](figures/ch00-fig4-dynaroute-86-percent-savings/final.png)
*Figure 0.4.* Routing every query to Llama 70B costs $1,500 per 1M queries. Routing by intent (700K easy + 200K medium + 100K hard) costs $215. That is an 86% reduction with no measurable change in user experience on the simple queries.

The figure makes the decomposition explicit: the easy queries cost only $35, medium $30, hard $150, total $215. The $1,500 "send everything to the 70B" baseline is almost entirely wasted compute on queries the 1B model would have answered correctly. Every enterprise deploying a single-model-fits-all policy in 2026 is leaving roughly 80% of their LLM budget on the table. An inference engineer's first question, on arriving at any new product, is: *do all our queries really need the biggest model?*

| Approach | Cost for 1M queries |
| --- | --- |
| All queries → Llama 70B | **$1,500** |
| DynaRoute: 700K easy + 200K medium + 100K hard | **$215** |
| Savings | **86%** |

Notice what has to be true for this to work. **The classifier itself has to be fast**. If the router adds 500 ms of latency before the small model even starts, we have saved money and destroyed the user experience. The classifier must add 20 ms or less. It has to be a tiny model, served with the same discipline as the big models behind it. **That is also inference engineering.**

Notice also what the router cannot afford to do. It cannot make the wrong call often. If it sends "Derive Navier-Stokes" to the 1B model and the answer is embarrassing, the brand is damaged. So the classifier is itself a production inference system with its own TTFT budget, its own quality bar, its own concurrency story. Inference engineering sits on top of inference engineering.

Between Vizz AI and DynaRoute, Vizuara's engineering work is almost entirely in the **serving layer**, not the training layer. I find this to be true of every serious application company I talk to. The question they are all trying to answer is the same:

> How do we take an open-source model and serve it at production quality, fast, cheap, and at scale?

This is the definition of inference engineering, and this book exists to answer that question completely.

### 0.3: The inference spectrum: not one kind of serving, seven

Inference does not run in one place. It runs across a spectrum of hardware, each with its own wall-clock performance and its own constraints.

![Figure 0.1: The Inference Spectrum](figures/ch01-fig6-inference-spectrum/final.png)
*Figure 0.1.* Inference runs on six hardware tiers: Raspberry Pi, phone, consumer laptop, consumer GPU, data-center GPU, and dedicated inference silicon. Cloud APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini) abstract the underlying tier. Specialty silicon (Cerebras, Taalas) sits in its own class above cloud APIs in tokens per second.

The figure shows six hardware tiers in order from least to most powerful. Far left is an edge microcontroller or Raspberry Pi, running a 1–5 tokens per second inference engine against a 125M-parameter model, useful for low-bandwidth offline applications. Far right is dedicated inference silicon. **Cerebras** reaches 1,000–3,000 tokens per second by fitting the entire model onto a wafer-scale chip (900,000 cores, no off-chip memory, no memory hierarchy to fight). **Taalas** goes further. Taalas literally *burns the trained model into the silicon mask*: every weight becomes a transistor, every activation is a wire. The resulting ASIC runs only that one model, but runs it at **~17,000 tokens per second**, roughly ten times faster than Cerebras at the same model size.

Above the hardware spectrum, floating on their own, are the cloud APIs. OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, their endpoints abstract away the underlying tier entirely. When you call GPT-5, you do not know if it is running on H100s, B200s, or a TPU cluster. You pay for tokens and you receive them. The cost is convenience. The hidden cost is that your latency, your data privacy, and your per-token price are all set by the provider's own inference stack, and **if they can improve their inference stack, you benefit. If they cannot, your product stalls.**

An inference engineer's first decision is: **which tier does this workload belong on?** A live voice tutor needs consumer-grade or better; a batch summarization job can run on consumer GPUs overnight; a personalized recommender can live on the user's phone. A single product may use three tiers at once.

---

### 0.4: The on-device push, led by Apple

One tier on the spectrum deserves its own section, because it is the one most likely to change the shape of the industry over the next two years.

Apple does not train a frontier large language model. It does not want to. What Apple wants, and what its hardware has been pointing at for four years now, is for **every one of its devices to run the inference locally, on the silicon the user already owns, with no cloud round-trip at all**.

![Figure 0.2: Apple's on-device inference strategy](figures/ch01-fig7-apple-on-device/final.png)
*Figure 0.2.* Apple's strategy: ship LLM-capable silicon in every device (MacBook, Mac mini, iPad, iPhone), run models locally via the CPU/GPU/Neural Engine sharing unified memory, and future-ship apps with preinstalled LLM-powered features. User data never leaves the device; latency is bounded only by silicon, not by network.

The figure shows four Apple devices, MacBook Pro, Mac mini, iPad, iPhone, each connected to the same underlying **Apple Silicon** block (CPU + GPU + Neural Engine) wrapped in a unified-memory ring. The crucial property of this silicon is the *unified memory architecture*: the CPU and GPU share the same physical RAM, so moving a model from CPU to GPU costs no memory copies. An M-series Mac with 128 GB of unified memory can hold a 70B-parameter model at FP8 in entirety, with no partitioning and no streaming from disk.

Apple's bet is that **every app shipped on macOS and iOS over the next two years will include its own LLM-powered features**, preinstalled, running locally, with zero per-token cost to Apple and zero data leaving the device. Siri becomes a real assistant. Notes summarizes. Mail drafts replies. FaceTime transcribes. The per-device cost to Apple is zero. The privacy story is the strongest in the industry.

For the inference engineer, this shifts the problem. On-device inference has to fit in 4–12 GB of memory (phones) or 16–128 GB (Macs), runs without a massive thermal budget, and cannot rely on a data center for overflow. The techniques we will study in this book, quantization to FP8 or INT4, compressed attention caches, lightweight speculative decoding, are the techniques that make on-device inference feasible. Apple has not replaced the cloud; Apple has made the on-device tier a first-class engineering target for every company that wants to ship consumer AI.

What about Alexa, Siri today, and Google Assistant? They all try to do on-device inference and they all fail at the hardest part: latency. When you talk to today's Alexa, the audio goes to the cloud, gets transcribed, the text is routed to an LLM that lives in AWS, the response is sent back, TTS runs somewhere, and the audio streams to your speaker. The round trip is 1.5 to 3 seconds. The reason is inference engineering, no one has yet shipped a consumer voice assistant where the full LLM lives on the device and responds in under 300 ms. That is an open engineering problem. Apple is closest. Whoever solves it first will own the next decade of consumer AI.

Figure 0.4 captures exactly how that shows up to the user. Take a question like "What is a black hole, and why do they exist near the centre of galaxies?" Ask it to Alexa and you will get a retrieval-first, web-link-shaped answer, because the serving stack behind Alexa has not yet been upgraded to stream a modern LLM in real time. Ask the same question in any modern chat interface and you will get a coherent, paragraph-long, streamed answer. The model that could answer it properly has existed for years. What has not existed, inside Alexa or Siri, is the inference-engineering stack to serve that model in real time on a home-assistant speaker with a 300-millisecond budget. This is one of the cleanest demonstrations I know that the bottleneck in consumer AI today is not model quality. It is serving.

![Figure 0.4: The voice-assistant inference gap](figures/ch00-fig6-alexa-siri-gap/final.png)
*Figure 0.4.* Left: legacy voice assistants (Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant) returning incoherent, retrieval-first answers to a normal user question. Right: a modern LLM returning a coherent, streamed, paragraph-long answer to the same question. The models that sit behind the right-hand column exist. The gap between the two columns is the inference-engineering stack required to serve them inside a real-time voice product, streaming TTFT under 300 ms, disciplined KV cache, careful scheduling. Until that stack ships inside a consumer assistant, the LLM boom, as far as the living-room speaker is concerned, has not actually happened.

---

### 0.5: What an inference engineer actually does

The job is a loop. Figure 0.5 sketches it.

![Figure 0.5: What an inference engineer does](figures/ch00-fig5-what-an-inference-engineer-does/final.png)
*Figure 0.5.* Six stations arranged as a loop: download the model, measure the product's SLOs, choose runtime optimizations, choose infrastructure layout, deploy via a serving engine, benchmark and iterate. The loop restarts every six weeks, because that is how often the frontier open-source model is refreshed.

The figure shows why the job is a *discipline* rather than a one-time project. Station 1, download the model, is the easiest step; anyone can do it. Stations 2 through 6 are where the entire technical content of this book lives. Station 2 asks what the product actually needs: a voice tutor needs TTFT under 300 ms, a batch summarizer does not. Station 3 is the **runtime layer**, attention variants, quantization, KV cache tricks, the inner ring we will spend most of this book on. Station 4 is the **infrastructure layer**, how to replicate, parallelize, and disaggregate across many GPUs. Station 5 is the **tooling layer**, which serving engine (vLLM, SGLang, TensorRT-LLM, Ray Serve) makes stations 3 and 4 deployable. Station 6 is benchmarking, which is non-negotiable: you do not know whether you improved a system unless you measured it before and after.

That last loop-back is important. A new frontier open-source model drops roughly every six weeks. Each new model has different architecture choices, different number of heads, different quantization tolerance, different context length, and a stack that was optimal for Llama-3 may be merely good for Llama-4 and bad for DeepSeek-V4. The inference engineer does not ship once; the inference engineer ships continuously, re-running the loop.

That is the job. It is part computer architecture, part systems engineering, part numerical analysis, and part economics. It is also, as of 2026, the single highest-leverage role in applied AI: Anthropic, NVIDIA, OpenAI, Microsoft, AWS, Apple, Red Hat, and every serious product company is staffing up inference-engineering teams as fast as they can hire. Compensation reflects it.

This book's job is to make you the engineer at the center of Figure 0.5.

## Three Layers You Must Learn in This Order

Every decision, tool, and technique in inference engineering lives in **one of three layers**. Think of them as concentric rings, where the inner ring must be mastered before the outer rings matter. Figure 0.6 is the single picture I want you to carry in your head for the rest of this book.

![Figure 0.6: The three layers of inference engineering](figures/ch00-fig7-three-layers-circular/final.png)
*Figure 0.6.* Three concentric rings. The innermost ring is the **runtime layer**, the question of how fast a single GPU can be pushed. The middle ring is the **infrastructure layer**, the question of how to serve a million users by coordinating many GPUs. The outermost ring is the **tooling layer**, the question of which serving engine and orchestration stack lets you actually ship. The ordering is strict, the inner ring must be mastered before the outer rings matter, and the full-stack inference engineer is the one who can sit in the centre and reason across all three at once. Chapter 1 explodes each of these three rings into its constituent techniques; here, hold the map.

### 0.6: Runtime layer: "how fast can one GPU go?"

The innermost ring. Before you think about how to scale, before you pick a serving framework, before you price out cloud GPUs, you must understand how to run a single model on a single GPU as fast as it will go.

This is where attention variants live (**MHA, MQA, GQA, MLA, sliding-window attention, linear attention, state-space models, Mamba**). It is where kernel optimizations live (**FlashAttention, PagedAttention, prefix caching**). It is where the number representation lives (**FP16, FP8, INT4 quantization, GPTQ, GGUF, QAT**). It is where the decode loop itself is rearranged (**continuous batching, chunked prefill, speculative decoding**).

Every optimization in this layer is, at its core, about one question:
**how do I push more useful work through this single GPU per second?**

### 0.7: Infrastructure layer: "how do we serve a million users?"

The middle ring. Once you know how fast one GPU goes, the question becomes: how do we replicate, coordinate, and deploy that speed across dozens, hundreds, or thousands of GPUs.

Infrastructure-layer techniques are about **parallelism**: tensor parallelism splits a single matmul across GPUs inside a node; pipeline parallelism splits the layers across nodes; expert parallelism distributes the experts of a mixture-of-experts model; sequence and context parallelism split long sequences across devices so that a single 128K-token prompt fits. And **disaggregated prefill/decode**: putting prefill on one pool of GPUs and decode on another, so that a long prompt from one user cannot stall another user's streaming response.

Infrastructure is about orchestration, topology, networking (NVLink vs InfiniBand), and replication. It is about the moment of truth when the one GPU is no longer enough.

### 0.8: Tooling layer: "what lets me ship?"

The outer ring. Nobody writes a FlashAttention kernel from scratch for every new product. We stand on the shoulders of serving engines: **vLLM**, **SGLang**, **TensorRT-LLM**, **Hugging Face TGI**, **Ray Serve**, **Modal**. Each is a package of the runtime and infrastructure techniques from the inner rings, plus a surface area that lets an engineer deploy in hours instead of months.

The tooling layer is where the inference engineer's productivity comes from. The innermost two rings are the reason the engineer can choose and tune the tool.

> **A working inference engineer sits at the intersection of all three rings.** Not knowing the runtime layer means your tooling choice is arbitrary. Not knowing the infrastructure layer means your runtime optimizations cannot scale. Not knowing the tooling layer means you cannot ship. This book covers all three, in order.

## How This Book Is Organized

You are reading Chapter 0. Over the next twenty-six chapters, this book will take you from the motivation you have just read through every technique I have named, in the order an inference engineer encounters them. The full journey is laid out in Figure 0.6.

![Figure 0.6: The book's journey map](figures/ch00-fig6-book-journey-map/final.png)
*Figure 0.6.* Twenty-six chapters across eight parts. The widest block, Part III, the Runtime Layer, is the largest because it is the heart of the book: nine chapters on KV cache, attention variants, quantization, and batching. You are in Part 0 right now. Every four chapters a breadcrumb page marks where you are on the map.

Part 0 (where you are) is motivation and the five metrics. Part I takes a single token's journey from the embedding table through prefill and decode, and introduces the **GPU roofline**, a single diagram we will come back to in almost every subsequent chapter. Part II is one chapter on the GPU hardware itself, only the parts that touch an inference decision. Part III, the widest block in Figure 0.6, is the heart of the book: nine chapters on runtime-layer techniques. Part IV is infrastructure; Part V is tooling; Part VI is fine-tuning; Part VII is frontiers (multimodal and embodied inference); Part VIII is three capstone projects you will build end-to-end.

**Part I, A Token's Journey.** What actually happens when a token enters a transformer, and why inference differs from pre-training. Chapters 1 through 5.

**Part II, The GPU, Through the Lens of Inference.** A single chapter on the hardware. Not a complete GPU architecture textbook, only the parts that touch an inference decision. Chapter 6.

**Part III, The Runtime Layer.** The heart of the book. Attention variants, the KV cache, FlashAttention, PagedAttention, quantization, continuous batching, speculative decoding. Chapters 7 through 15.

**Part IV, The Infrastructure Layer.** Parallelism and disaggregation, replication and routing. Chapters 16 through 18.

**Part V, The Tooling Layer.** vLLM in detail, plus the engine landscape in 2026. Chapters 19 through 21.

**Part VIII, Capstones.** Three hands-on projects: a speed-optimized inference server, scaling that server to a million users on Modal, and OpenClaw-RL, a self-improving WhatsApp assistant that turns every conversation into training data. Chapters 24 through 26.

Each chapter follows the same three-part rhythm: first the motivation and the gap, then the mechanism, then the numerical payoff and where it lands on the GPU roofline. Almost every chapter ends by locating its technique on one shared diagram, the **GPU roofline**, that you will meet for the first time in Chapter 3 and then encounter in every runtime chapter that follows.

Every four chapters, we pause for a **breadcrumb**, a short page reflecting on what you have covered and pointing at what is next. You have signed up for a twenty-six-chapter journey; it helps to mark where you are on the map.

## 0.9: The reader I am writing for, and why this book exists

Let me tell you honestly why this book exists. There is no shortage of material on training large language models: papers, courses, Andrej Karpathy's lectures, a whole shelf of textbooks, and, as I mentioned at the start of this chapter, my own *Build an LLM from Scratch* series. But when I finally set out to teach inference the way I had learned to teach training, from first principles, with all the matrix multiplications visible on the page, with worked examples where you can feel each byte being loaded from HBM, I could not find the equivalent book. The material existed, scattered across vLLM source code, NVIDIA blog posts, Dao's FlashAttention papers, SGLang's design docs, DeepSeek's tech reports, and a hundred podcast appearances. But there was no single place where a serious engineer could sit down and learn the entire field, from a single arithmetic-intensity calculation on one GPU all the way up to a multi-region serving cluster, with the math visible and the intuition named out loud.

So I decided to write it. The goal of this book, very simply, is to fill that gap. To take you all the way down to the matmul level, and then all the way back up to the production stack, in one coherent story. I have tied every idea to a visual (the journey map you will see in Figure 0.6, the roofline you will meet in Chapter 3, the three concentric rings of Chapter 1) and to a concrete practical (runnable code, actual benchmark numbers, three capstone projects in Chapters 24 through 26 that you can build on your own hardware).

I am writing for the engineer who has used an OpenAI or Anthropic API, who knows what a matrix multiply is, who has seen a transformer in PyTorch, and who would now like to understand what is really happening when that transformer is *served*. You do not need to know what arithmetic intensity is, or what MLA does, or what a KV cache looks like inside HBM, or why FlashAttention was even invented. Every one of those ideas is built from the ground up in the chapters ahead. I will not ask you to take anything on faith.

My hope, as you finish the last page of Chapter 26, is that you see the beauty of this field the way I have come to see it, as a deeply mathematical, deeply practical, deeply human craft. And, concretely, that you can walk into any serious engineering interview in 2026 and answer the one question almost every infrastructure team now asks:

> **"Design a low-latency, high-throughput LLM inference system handling millions of requests. Walk me through the engineering trade-offs."**

By the time you finish this book, that question should feel less like an interview riddle and more like a conversation you have already had with yourself, many times, while reading these pages.

## 0.10: Where we go next

The next chapter, **Chapter 1: The Three Layers**, takes the runtime/infrastructure/tooling map you just saw and unpacks each ring in full detail. By the end of Chapter 1 you will be able to name every technique in this book and place it in the correct ring.

# Chapter 1: The Three Layers

In Chapter 0 we named them: **runtime**, **infrastructure**, **tooling**. That was a label. This chapter makes the label precise. By the end of Chapter 1 you will be able to point at any technique in this book, FlashAttention, tensor parallelism, vLLM, chunked prefill, speculative decoding, NVLink, MLA, and say which of the three layers it belongs to, what question it answers, and why it exists.

That matters because every chapter that follows implicitly asks one question: *which layer does this belong to, and what does it change?* If you do not know the map, the techniques feel arbitrary. If you know the map, every chapter snaps into place.

Let us start with the question most engineers skip.

---

## What Breaks When You Skip a Layer?

### 1.1: The most common failure mode in applied AI, 2026

A startup hires a solid ML engineer. They have a product idea. The engineer does the obvious thing: pick a model (Llama-3-8B, let's say), pick a serving engine (vLLM, because everyone uses it), push it to a cloud GPU, and ship.

For the first thousand users it works. Then traffic spikes. Time to first token jumps from 300 ms to 2.4 seconds. The engineer adds a second GPU, then a third. Costs triple. The product feels slower than before, not faster. Customers complain. Investors ask questions. The engineer stares at the vLLM config and does not know which of the 40 flags to turn.

The problem is not that the engineer is bad. The problem is that the engineer **picked one layer, the tooling, and skipped the other two**. vLLM is extraordinary software. It is also not a magic box. If you do not understand the runtime layer underneath it, you cannot tune its flags. If you do not understand the infrastructure layer around it, you cannot deploy more than one replica without the throughput collapsing into latency spikes.

This is why the three layers are introduced in the order they are. **Runtime first**, because it is the ground truth of how fast any single GPU can go. **Infrastructure second**, because scaling only makes sense once you know what you are scaling. **Tooling third**, because tools are a package of the first two, and picking a tool without understanding what is inside it is how startups burn $100K per month on cloud bills and still miss their SLOs.

The rest of this chapter explains each layer in full, in that order, so that when this book turns to specific techniques (Chapter 7 onward) you know exactly where each one lives.

---

## The Three Layers, Precisely

### 1.2: The stack, seen as three concentric rings

Figure 1.1 is the map that the rest of this book fills in.

![Figure 1.1: The Three Layers of Inference Engineering](figures/ch01-fig1-three-layers/final.png)
*Figure 1.1.* A vertical stack. Bottom: the **runtime layer**, how fast one GPU can go. Middle: the **infrastructure layer**, how to serve a million users. Top: the **tooling layer**, the libraries that package the first two. Under the stack, a horizontal axis from "one GPU" to "shippable product."

Three observations about Figure 1.1:

First, the layers are **stacked, not parallel**. You cannot reason about the infrastructure layer without understanding the runtime layer, because every parallelism strategy in the infrastructure layer changes the per-GPU arithmetic intensity in a way you can only evaluate if you know what arithmetic intensity *is*, and that is a runtime-layer concept.

Second, the layers **get thinner as you go up**. The runtime layer has dozens of techniques, each one a non-trivial research contribution. The infrastructure layer has a handful, parallelism, disaggregation, replication, routing, and the hard part is the networking physics underneath. The tooling layer has four or five production-grade engines and a decision matrix between them. By the time you reach the top, you are choosing among known quantities; by the time you are at the bottom, you are inventing.

Third, the horizontal axis under Figure 1.1 matters. Moving from left to right is moving from **one GPU** to **many GPUs** to **a deployed product**. This is not just a matter of scale; each step changes which techniques are available. A one-GPU problem and a thousand-GPU problem are not the same problem with a larger batch size, they are qualitatively different problems, and the book's structure reflects that.

Let us now walk each layer in detail.

---

### 1.3: The Runtime Layer: "how fast can ONE GPU go?"

The runtime layer answers exactly one question: given a model already loaded onto a single GPU, **how do I make it produce the most useful tokens per second?** That is the whole scope. Not "how many GPUs do I need", that is the next layer. Not "which library should I use", that is the layer above. Just: this GPU, this model, how fast.

Figure 1.2 unpacks the runtime layer into its five major technique families.

![Figure 1.2: Inside the Runtime Layer](figures/ch01-fig2-runtime-inside/final.png)
*Figure 1.2.* Five clusters of techniques orbit one central question, "one GPU, faster." Each cluster is a separate escape from one fundamental constraint of the GPU, and the rest of this book spends multiple chapters on each.

Figure 1.2 shows five clusters. Let me describe each one briefly; the full treatment of each begins in Chapter 7 and continues through Chapter 15.

**Cluster 1, Attention variants.** The attention mechanism, as originally defined in the 2017 Transformer paper, uses a large number of independent "heads," each of which maintains its own keys and values. This is called **Multi-Head Attention (MHA)**. It is expensive at inference time because every head's keys and values must be cached separately for every past token, so the cache grows linearly with the number of heads. Inference engineers have invented several ways to shrink it: **Multi-Query Attention (MQA)** where all heads share one K and one V; **Grouped-Query Attention (GQA)** where heads are grouped so that each group shares a K/V pair; and **Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA)** where K and V are compressed through a lower-dimensional latent space. Every modern frontier open-source model (Llama, Qwen, DeepSeek, Mistral) uses one of these three.

**Cluster 2, Compressing the attention across tokens.** Even after you have compressed across heads, a much more stubborn problem remains. The attention cache, by definition, grows with the length of the conversation. If two users are sitting on the same GPU, and one is on turn three of a ten-token chat and the other is on turn three hundred of a long research session with retrieved documents injected into every message, the second user is costing roughly a hundred and twenty-eight times more KV-cache memory than the first. This linear growth with context length is the reason a GPU that comfortably serves a hundred short-conversation users can collapse to five users as soon as those users start pasting in long documents. A whole family of architectural ideas attacks this specific problem, and each of them trades off something different. **Sliding-window attention** says "let us simply forget anything older than the last *W* tokens," which caps the cache at a fixed size but weakens long-range reasoning. **Linear attention** removes the softmax so that past keys and values can be collapsed into a single constant-size running state, which is mathematically elegant but tends to reduce retrieval quality on tasks that depend on sharp lookups. **State-space models** reformulate attention as a linear recurrence that can still be parallelized via convolution. **Mamba** takes the same state-space idea and makes the transition matrices input-dependent, recovering some of the selectivity that pure linear recurrences gave up. None of these are free lunches. Modern production architectures very rarely go all-in on any one of them; instead they mix attention layers with Mamba or SSM layers in the same network, keeping the cache savings from one and the exact retrieval from the other. The lesson is that "compressing across tokens" is not a solved problem with a single right answer. It is a menu of trade-offs that an inference engineer has to understand before choosing a hybrid.

**Cluster 3, Memory-traffic rearrangement.** The most surprising thing I tell engineers when they start learning inference is that a modern GPU, for a single-user decode step, spends roughly ninety-nine percent of its wall-clock time *moving bytes*, not computing on them. The GPU's memory hierarchy has three tiers that matter: the on-chip SRAM (tens of kilobytes per streaming multiprocessor, absurdly fast), the L2 cache (tens of megabytes, still fast), and the HBM (tens of gigabytes, the slow tier everyone talks about). Standard attention, implemented naively, reads and writes the full attention-score matrix from HBM many times per layer, which is like driving to the warehouse and back again for every single nut and bolt. The whole cluster of techniques in this group is about rearranging that memory traffic. **FlashAttention** tiles the computation so that the score matrix never actually lives in HBM at all; it is built, used, and discarded entirely inside on-chip SRAM. **PagedAttention** borrows virtual-memory ideas from operating systems, instead of over-allocating a worst-case KV buffer per user, it fragments the cache into small fixed-size blocks and packs them wherever there is room, so the GPU can hold many more concurrent users. **Prefix caching** notices that the first few thousand tokens of every user's request are often identical (your system prompt, your retrieval template, the common chat history of a power user) and refuses to recompute the keys and values for those tokens a second time. **Chunked prefill** cuts long prompts into smaller pieces so that one user's three-thousand-token prompt does not freeze out everybody else who is mid-decode. Each of these techniques was a research paper in its own right, and each one is now a line item in the vLLM configuration file. Chapters 10 through 12 walk through them one by one.

**Cluster 4, Quantization.** The weights of a 70B-parameter model, stored in FP16, take 140 GB. On an H100 that has 80 GB of HBM, that model does not fit. **Quantization** is the art of compressing the weights into a lower-precision format, FP8, INT8, INT4, or even 1.58 bits, while preserving enough quality that the model still works. This is both a per-token byte saving (less HBM traffic) and, with the right hardware, a per-operation FLOP saving (tensor cores can run faster on low-precision data). GPTQ and AWQ are post-training quantization algorithms; QAT is quantization-aware fine-tuning; BitNet pushes the limits toward ternary weights.

**Cluster 5, Scheduling tricks.** Even with all the above, the decode loop emits one token per forward pass per user, which leaves most of the GPU idle. **Continuous batching** packs decode requests from many users into the same forward pass so the weights get loaded once and serve many tokens. **Speculative decoding** uses a cheap model to guess several tokens ahead, which the expensive model then verifies in a single forward pass, a free 2–4× speedup when the guesses are good.

The common thread across all five clusters is a single sentence:

> **Every runtime-layer technique is an attempt to get the maximum useful work out of the same GPU per second.**

The word *useful* matters here. It is tempting to read the runtime layer as a pure throughput game: squeeze out the most tokens per second, full stop. That is almost right, but not quite. Tokens only count if they keep the model's answers as good as they would have been without the optimization. Sliding-window attention, for instance, is wonderful for cache size but can quietly degrade long-range reasoning. That is why modern architectures mix state-space or Mamba layers with standard attention rather than replacing attention wholesale: we want the cache savings *and* the quality. Every technique in this book is judged on both axes at once, tokens per second, and the usefulness of those tokens. A method that doubles throughput while silently halving answer quality is not an optimization. It is a regression.

Maximum useful work per second shows up as higher throughput, lower latency, or both, without a quality regression. Every cluster attacks a different bottleneck, the attention cache, the memory hierarchy, the weight-byte budget, or the scheduling granularity, but they all resolve to the same metric. Chapter 3 will introduce the **GPU roofline** diagram, which is the book's way of placing every technique on a single common chart. We will come back to that chart in almost every chapter from 6 through 17.

---

### 1.4: The Infrastructure Layer: "how do we serve a million users?"

Once a single GPU is running at its limit, every attention optimization applied, the best quantization scheme in place, continuous batching on, speculative decoding working, the question changes. The product has more users than one GPU can absorb. What now?

The infrastructure layer is the set of techniques that coordinate multiple GPUs, multiple nodes, and multiple regions to meet a multi-user service-level objective. It is the middle ring.

Figure 1.3 unpacks it.

![Figure 1.3: Inside the Infrastructure Layer](figures/ch01-fig3-infrastructure-inside/final.png)
*Figure 1.3.* Five techniques orbit one central question, "many GPUs, at scale." Parallelism splits a single model across GPUs; disaggregation puts opposite workloads on specialized GPUs; replication clones the engine; routing directs traffic; multi-region places inference close to users.

Five techniques, each solving a specific coordination problem.

**Parallelism.** A 70B model at FP16 is 140 GB, which does not fit on one 80 GB GPU. So the model must be split across GPUs. There are five orthogonal ways to do this, and the first skill of an infrastructure-layer engineer is knowing which one matches the workload:

* **Tensor parallelism** splits each matmul column-wise. Each GPU holds a strip of the weight matrix, and the partial outputs are combined via an AllReduce. Because the AllReduce runs on every layer, tensor parallelism is bandwidth-hungry, it wants the ~900 GB/s NVLink fabric you only get between GPUs sitting inside a single server node.
* **Pipeline parallelism** splits the model across layer groups. GPU 0 holds layers 1 through 20, GPU 1 holds layers 21 through 40, and activations flow between them. The per-layer cross-GPU traffic is much smaller than tensor parallelism, which makes pipeline parallelism the right choice when you have to cross nodes, over InfiniBand at ~50 GB/s.
* **Expert parallelism** is the trick behind modern mixture-of-experts models. Each expert (a feed-forward sub-network) lives on a different GPU, and a lightweight router decides which experts to wake up for any given token. It turns a 600B-parameter MoE model into something that costs roughly as much per token as a 30B dense model.
* **Sequence parallelism** splits the non-attention operations (LayerNorm, dropout, residual adds) along the token axis. It is a smaller optimization but it plays well with tensor parallelism and reduces activation memory.
* **Context parallelism** splits a single very long context, think one million tokens, across GPUs so that the KV cache for that one sequence fits at all. It is the technique that makes million-token chat possible without a single GPU holding a hundred gigabytes of cache for a single user.

Parallelism is the first and largest technique family in the infrastructure layer. Every deployment above a few billion parameters uses at least one of these, and production stacks routinely compose three or four of them at once.

**Disaggregated prefill/decode.** Prefill is compute-bound; decode is memory-bound. Running them on the same GPU causes a problem: when a new user arrives with a 16,000-token prompt, the prefill saturates the GPU and every other user's decode stalls for the duration. P99 latency spikes from 50 ms to 900 ms. The solution is to put prefill on one pool of GPUs and decode on another. The KV cache is transferred between them after prefill completes. This is the architecture NVIDIA's NIM runs, and the architecture DeepSeek runs, and the architecture vLLM v1 is moving toward. It is the single most important production-serving technique of 2026.

**Replication.** Horizontally scaling the same engine. Two vLLM replicas serve twice as many users as one. The hard part is not running two replicas, it is provisioning them fast enough that when traffic spikes, a new replica boots before the in-flight users see their latency collapse. Cold starts (loading 140 GB of weights into HBM) take several minutes, so production systems keep a buffer of warm replicas.

**Routing.** Once you have many replicas, something has to decide which request goes where. A dumb round-robin router is fine for uniform workloads, but real workloads are not uniform: some users have long system prompts, some have short; some need fast responses, some are running batch jobs. Smart routing uses per-replica load signals, prefix-cache awareness, and SLO tagging to match each request to the replica most likely to serve it fastest. This is the control plane of a serving fleet.

**Multi-region deployment.** Data travels at roughly two-thirds the speed of light through fiber. A user in Singapore talking to a GPU in Virginia pays ~200 ms of round-trip latency before inference even begins. For interactive workloads (voice tutors, voice assistants), that is a product-killing budget. Production systems deploy the same engine into multiple cloud regions and route users to their nearest one.

The common thread across the infrastructure layer is another one-sentence summary:

> **Every infrastructure-layer technique is an attempt to coordinate many GPUs as if they were one.**

This layer is where topology and networking physics dominate. The NVLink-to-InfiniBand bandwidth ratio (roughly 18:1) determines which parallelism strategies work inside a node versus across nodes. This is not a choice you make after the fact; it is a hard constraint that shapes the architecture. We will spend Chapters 16-18 on this layer.

---

### 1.5: The Tooling Layer: "what lets me ship?"

Nobody writes a FlashAttention kernel from scratch for every new product. Nobody implements tensor parallelism from first principles for every new model. The tooling layer is the set of **serving engines**, software packages that bundle the runtime and infrastructure techniques from the two lower layers and expose them through a production API.

Figure 1.4 shows the four engines that matter in 2026.

![Figure 1.4: Inside the Tooling Layer](figures/ch01-fig4-tooling-inside/final.png)
*Figure 1.4.* Four production serving engines: vLLM (the default), SGLang (structured generation and RadixAttention), TensorRT-LLM (NVIDIA's compiled kernels), and Ray Serve (distributed orchestration). Each packages a different subset of the runtime and infrastructure layers.

**vLLM** is the default choice for almost every new deployment in 2026. It was the first production-grade engine to ship PagedAttention (2023), and has continued to lead on features: continuous batching, chunked prefill, prefix caching, speculative decoding, multi-LoRA serving, guided decoding. Its scheduler is open-source and well-understood. The community is large; the release cadence is fast. If you have no strong reason to use something else, use vLLM.

**SGLang** is the right choice when you need structured generation, JSON schema, regex, or finite-state-machine-constrained output. Its **RadixAttention** indexes the prefix cache as a radix tree, which means it finds maximal shared prefixes across unrelated queries (not just within a conversation). For tree-of-thought prompting, agentic loops, and structured-output workflows, SGLang outperforms vLLM.

**TensorRT-LLM** is NVIDIA's compiled serving engine. It is the highest-performance option on NVIDIA hardware, at the cost of a slow compile step and NVIDIA-only portability. It integrates tightly with Hopper's asynchronous memory accelerators and FP8 tensor cores. If your model is frozen, your hardware is NVIDIA, and your workload is high-volume production traffic, TensorRT-LLM will give you the best per-GPU throughput.

**Ray Serve** is not a single-engine replacement, it is an orchestration layer *over* vLLM (or any of the others). It handles autoscaling, multi-replica routing, multi-model ensembles, and distribution across a GPU cluster. The production reference architecture of 2026 is **Ray Serve + vLLM**: one instance of vLLM per replica, Ray Serve coordinating replicas across the cluster.

There are other engines (TGI from Hugging Face, LMDeploy, Together, Modal's serverless offering), and there are specialty runtimes (llama.cpp for CPU/Apple Silicon, MLC for on-device). The full landscape is the subject of Chapter 20. For now, the one-sentence summary:

> **Every tooling-layer choice is an attempt to make the runtime and infrastructure layers deployable in hours instead of months.**

The tooling layer is the fastest-moving of the three. Engines rewrite themselves every year to incorporate the latest runtime tricks. vLLM's internal architecture was substantially rewritten in 2025 (the "v1" rewrite) to handle disaggregated prefill/decode. Expect that to continue: in 2028 the default engine may not be vLLM. The underlying runtime and infrastructure techniques, however, will still be the same ones described in Chapters 7 through 18. The techniques last longer than the packaging.

---

## The Inference Engineer Lives in the Intersection

### 1.6: Why all three layers matter at once

We return now to the startup from §1.1, the one whose engineer picked vLLM and hoped for the best. The mistake was not vLLM. vLLM is excellent. The mistake was treating the tooling layer as if it were the whole stack.

Figure 1.5 draws this geometrically.

![Figure 1.5: Where the Inference Engineer Sits](figures/ch01-fig5-engineer-intersection/final.png)
*Figure 1.5.* Three overlapping circles, runtime, infrastructure, tooling. A working inference engineer lives in the deeper-lavender triple-intersection in the center. Knowing any one or two layers is incomplete. The combinations explain the common failure modes.

The figure shows three overlapping circles. Each pairwise overlap, and the triple overlap in the center, corresponds to a real role in the industry. It is worth being explicit about each.

**Runtime only.** Academic ML researchers who understand attention variants and quantization algorithms in depth, but have never deployed a model. They can write a FlashAttention kernel but cannot tell you what ITL their deployment achieved last week. Useful for inventing new techniques; not useful for shipping products.

**Infrastructure only.** Cloud-ops and SRE engineers who understand how to scale a service, load-balance replicas, and autoscale by CPU utilization. They can run 100 replicas of any binary. They will happily run 100 replicas of an *unoptimized* binary and wonder why the bill is $100K per month. Useful for running a serving fleet; not useful for making the individual engines fast.

**Tooling only.** The startup engineer from §1.1. Knows how to call vLLM's API. Cannot tune it when the defaults break. Will often over-provision hardware as a substitute for tuning. This is the most common mistake in applied AI today.

**Runtime + Infrastructure, no Tooling.** Rare. Usually academic research groups that are building their own in-house serving stack. They can get remarkable per-GPU performance, but their systems are not maintainable by anyone else, so nothing ever ships to production.

**Runtime + Tooling, no Infrastructure.** Common among early-stage teams. They know how to pick a good engine (vLLM) and tune its flags, but when traffic crosses one GPU, they do not know how to design the replica topology. They hit a scaling wall at around 100-500 concurrent users.

**Infrastructure + Tooling, no Runtime.** The classic ops-first team. They can scale out; they cannot make individual replicas efficient. Their unit economics never converge; every additional user costs the same as the last one because they cannot compress the per-user cost.

**The center, all three.** This is the position the book is training you for. A working inference engineer understands what is happening inside vLLM, why PagedAttention changes the scheduler's calculus, how tensor parallelism changes the arithmetic intensity per GPU, when to add a replica versus when to tune the existing one, and which metric to push against on which day. The job is to see the entire stack, top to bottom, and tune where the leverage is.

---

### 1.7: The map, ready to be filled in

Now you have the map. For the rest of this book, the map is going to sit just behind every page like a piece of graph paper under tracing paper. Every new technique you meet is a dot somewhere on Figure 1.1, and by the end of the book you will be able to look at a paper or a release note and place it there without thinking, *this is a runtime trick, it lives in the attention cluster; that is an infrastructure trick, it lives in the disaggregation cluster; that one over there is tooling, it belongs in the vLLM box.* This is not a party game. This is the mental habit that separates engineers who can reason about inference from engineers who memorize it.

There is one more thing worth saying now, because I want you to be prepared for it. **The boundaries between the layers are never as clean as a book chapter will pretend.** PagedAttention is catalogued in the runtime ring because it is a change to how attention is computed on one GPU, but its real value only shows up in production because of what it unlocks in the infrastructure ring: continuous batching across many users would quietly collapse under KV-cache fragmentation without it, and the very reason it was invented was to solve that infrastructure problem. Speculative decoding is a runtime-layer trick, strictly speaking, and yet it is really a two-model trick, and the moment you have a draft model plus a target model, you have an infrastructure question on your hands about where the draft model lives. These crossovers are not rough edges in the pedagogy. They are, in my experience, exactly where the most interesting production problems sit. That is why, in Figure 1.5, the three-way intersection is labeled *full-stack inference engineer*: the engineer who can work across the layers is the one companies actually need.

A final note on the order in which we will walk through the remaining parts of the book. The book proceeds roughly bottom-up, and the order is deliberate. Part I shows you how a token actually moves through a transformer, so that when we later talk about optimizing *something*, you know exactly what that something is. Part II spends one chapter on the GPU itself, because you cannot reason about a bottleneck without knowing what the bottleneck is made of, how SRAM talks to HBM, how a tensor core actually schedules a matmul, what a warp is. Part III is the long heart of the book, the runtime layer, where nearly every chapter derives one technique that pushes a single GPU closer to its roofline. Part IV moves up to the infrastructure layer, where we talk about how to coordinate many of those GPUs. Part V introduces the tooling layer, the engines and orchestrators that turn all of this into something you can deploy on a Tuesday morning. The ordering is not aesthetic. It is, almost literally, the ordering an inference engineer runs through in their own head when they look at a new system for the first time: *what is it supposed to do; what is the hardware under it; what is the single-GPU bottleneck; how do I scale it; how do I ship it?* This is the order. This is the map. The rest of the book is filling it in.

---

### 1.8: Where we go next

The three layers told us *what* we will learn and *in what order*. They did not tell us *what we are trying to optimize*. That is the subject of Chapter 2: five numbers, time to first token, inter-token latency, tokens per second, latency percentiles, and dollars per million tokens, that every inference decision in this book ultimately moves.

# Chapter 2: Five Numbers You Will Live By

Chapter 1 gave us the map, three layers, and the question each one answers. That map told us *what* we were going to study and *in what order*. It did not tell us what we were going to *measure*.

That matters, because every technique in this book succeeds or fails against a number. FlashAttention is a 2.3× speedup against one number and a 0% improvement against another. Quantization is often a 40% cost reduction against one number and a 6% quality regression against another. Disaggregated prefill is a 7× improvement against one number and a 12% increase against another. You cannot reason about any of these trade-offs without first naming the numbers themselves.

In production, an inference engineer tracks five. Not three. Not ten. Five. Every dashboard in every serious inference deployment, OpenAI, Anthropic, NVIDIA's NIM, AWS Bedrock, DeepSeek's internal stack, shows you these five numbers and some flavor of their derivatives. Pick any one of them up and pull, and you touch every other concept in this book.

This chapter is where you learn what they mean, how they are measured, what each one hides from you, and which stakeholder in an organization cares about which. It is shorter than Chapter 1 because the content is cumulative: once you understand these five, every subsequent chapter is a discussion of how to move one of them without ruining the others.

---

## Why Metrics Come Before Techniques

### 2.1: The metrics dashboard, at a glance

Figure 2.1 is the mental dashboard. When I meet an inference engineer at a conference and ask them, "How is your deployment doing?", I expect answers in these five numbers. Not "fine" and not "working" and not "fast." These five, with real values.

![Figure 2.1: The Five Numbers of Inference](figures/ch02-fig1-five-metrics-dashboard/final.png)
*Figure 2.1.* Five cards, each naming one metric, its one-line definition, its unit, and a typical "good" target. TTFT, ITL, TPS, P99 latency, and dollars per million tokens.

Read Figure 2.1 twice. The first time, notice the definitions: **TTFT** is how long before the user sees anything; **ITL** is how fast the stream flows once it starts; **TPS** is the reciprocal of ITL and the metric users implicitly feel; **P99 latency** is the slowest one percent, the dangerous tail; and **$/M tokens** is the economic unit that determines whether a product is viable. The second time, notice the *units*. Four of the five are measured in milliseconds or tokens-per-second. The fifth is measured in dollars. An inference engineer sits at the boundary where those two kinds of units meet.

The rest of this chapter takes each metric, one at a time, and answers three questions for each: what is it, how is it measured, and what do you get wrong if you optimize it alone? At the end, in §2.7, we return to Figure 2.1 and ask which stakeholder in your organization cares about which metric. That matters because your CFO and your product manager and your on-call SRE will each tell you a different number is "the" number, and they will all be correct about their own concern, and wrong about the system.

A note before we start: I have seen engineers succeed against *any* of these metrics individually. I have never seen a team succeed in production without understanding the relationship between them. That relationship is the real subject of this chapter.

## The Five Numbers, One at a Time

### 2.2: TTFT: Time to First Token

**TTFT** is the wall-clock time from the moment the user's request hits your server to the moment they see the first output token appear on their screen. It is measured in milliseconds.

![Figure 2.2: Time to First Token](figures/ch02-fig2-ttft-timeline/final.png)
*Figure 2.2.* A horizontal timeline starting at t=0 (user sends prompt). A shaded block, the **prefill phase**, spans from t=0 to t=T. At t=T, the first token appears and decode streaming begins. TTFT = T milliseconds.

In Figure 2.2, the shaded region labeled "prefill phase" is the key to understanding TTFT. When a user sends a prompt, your model does **not** start generating output immediately. It first has to process the prompt itself, running it through the full transformer forward pass, computing K and V vectors for every input token, populating the KV cache. Only after this phase completes can decoding, the generation of new tokens, begin.

The length of the prefill phase is roughly proportional to the prompt length. A 100-token prompt prefills in ~15 ms on a modern GPU. A 10,000-token prompt prefills in ~1,500 ms. If your users are sending long conversations or long documents (chat with retrieved context, code with large files pasted in, legal documents), TTFT can dominate the entire user experience. On the 10,000-token prompt, the user sees a blank screen for one and a half seconds before anything appears. That is often an eternity in product terms.

TTFT is compute-bound. It scales with the *square* of prompt length (roughly), because the attention mechanism during prefill computes `N × N` attention scores across all pairs of prompt tokens. Doubling the prompt length roughly quadruples the prefill time, though FlashAttention and related techniques soften the constant factors considerably.

#### 2.2.1: Why TTFT matters more than you think

A user's perception of a streaming response is dominated by two moments: (a) the instant they press enter and (b) the instant the first word appears. The gap between these two moments is the time during which the interface is "dead." In a live voice tutor, a TTFT of 3 seconds produces an awkward silence that feels like a system failure. In a chat UI, it produces a flashing cursor that anxious users will interpret as a bug. Users do not reason about prefill; they do not know that a long prompt takes longer to process. They only know that nothing is happening.

For interactive workloads, the industry-standard TTFT target is **under 500 ms at P99** and **under 300 ms at P50** (median). If your P50 TTFT is 800 ms, users will report that the product is slow, even if your ITL is excellent. Chat UX research from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google all converges on this same budget, because it matches the human threshold at which a system stops feeling responsive.

For batch workloads, a summarization pipeline that processes 10,000 documents overnight, TTFT is almost meaningless. No one is watching. Only throughput and cost matter.

#### 2.2.2: Where TTFT regresses

Three things make TTFT worse, and we will see all three in later chapters:

* **Long prompts.** Doubling prompt length roughly quadruples prefill compute. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which injects document chunks into the prompt, is a frequent TTFT killer. We attack this in Chapter 12 with **prefix caching** (skip recomputing shared prefixes) and **chunked prefill** (do prefill in smaller chunks interleaved with ongoing decodes).
* **Contention.** If your GPU is currently serving other users' decodes, a new user's prefill cannot start immediately. The waiting time is added to TTFT. We attack this in Chapter 17 with **disaggregated prefill/decode**.
* **Cold starts.** If your serving replica has to boot (load model weights from disk, allocate the KV cache, capture CUDA graphs), TTFT on the first request can be minutes, not milliseconds. We attack this in Chapter 18 with warm pools.

The standard way to measure TTFT in production is to record the server-side timestamp when the HTTP request body is received, and the timestamp when the first SSE event (or WebSocket frame) containing output content is emitted. The difference is TTFT. Client-side TTFT is longer (it includes network round-trip), and should be reported separately.

---

### 2.3: ITL and TPS: The Streaming Rate

**ITL** (inter-token latency) is the average wall-clock time between two consecutive output tokens during the decode phase. It is measured in milliseconds per token. **TPS** (tokens per second) is its reciprocal, the rate at which output flows out, measured in tokens per second.

These two metrics measure the same thing from opposite angles:

```
TPS_per_user = 1000 / ITL_ms
```

An ITL of 50 ms/token means 20 tokens/sec. An ITL of 25 ms/token means 40 tokens/sec. Most published benchmarks quote one or the other, quote whichever your audience finds more intuitive. End users think in TPS ("this thing is slow"); engineers think in ITL ("decode steps are taking 80 ms").

![Figure 2.3: Inter-Token Latency and Tokens Per Second](figures/ch02-fig3-itl-and-tps/final.png)
*Figure 2.3.* A stream of output tokens flowing along a timeline, each separated by a gap labeled ITL. The equation `TPS = 1000 / ITL_ms` makes the relationship concrete: ITL = 50 ms gives TPS = 20 tokens per second.

Figure 2.3 shows a stream of tokens `w_1, w_2, ..., w_6` with equal ITL gaps between them. In reality, the gaps are not perfectly equal, a small variance exists from GPU kernel timing jitter, but the *average* is what ITL measures. The equation in the figure is the one piece of arithmetic you will use more often than any other in this book. Internalize it: **TPS and ITL are inverses**. If someone tells you their deployment hits 30 tokens/sec, you can say, "your ITL is 33 milliseconds" without looking anything up. This is useful in conversation.

#### 2.3.1: Why ITL is memory-bound

The decode loop produces **one token per forward pass**. Each forward pass must load the full weights of the model from HBM, every single layer, every single parameter, to compute the next token. A 7B-parameter model at FP16 is 14 GB of weights. Loading 14 GB at H100's 3.35 TB/s bandwidth takes `14 / 3350 = 4.18 ms` of pure memory traffic. You cannot go faster than that on H100 for this model, no matter what algorithm you use, because even if compute took zero time, the data still has to travel from HBM to the compute units.

This is **why decode is memory-bound** and why ITL is dominated by HBM bandwidth rather than arithmetic throughput. Every ITL improvement in this book is, at its core, a way to reduce the number of bytes that must flow through the HBM per generated token. Quantization (smaller bytes per parameter), flash attention (fewer reads from HBM), MLA (smaller KV cache to read), speculative decoding (more tokens per weight-load), they all reduce memory traffic per token.

Chapter 3 makes this mechanism precise by introducing the GPU roofline. For now, remember one fact: **ITL is limited by memory bandwidth, not by FLOPs**, for any transformer model of any realistic size during decode.

#### 2.3.2: Target ITL budgets

For interactive workloads, the ITL target is **under 50 ms** (equivalently, TPS > 20). This is slightly faster than human reading speed, so the output flows visibly but not frustratingly. An ITL over 100 ms (TPS < 10) feels laggy even to slow readers.

For voice workloads, the target is tighter, **under 30 ms** (TPS > 33). Voice requires tokens to arrive fast enough that the text-to-speech engine can buffer smoothly; stutter in voice output is immediately noticeable.

For batch workloads, the ITL of any single request does not matter; only aggregate system throughput does (see §2.4).

#### 2.3.3: Per-user TPS versus system TPS

This is the subtle point where a surprising number of engineers get confused in their first year.

There are **two different TPS numbers**, and they measure different things.

* **Per-user TPS** is how fast one user's stream flows, the reciprocal of that user's ITL.
* **System TPS** (also called "throughput") is the total output rate across all concurrent users.

If your engine serves 32 users concurrently, each at 20 tokens/sec per-user, the system TPS is 32 × 20 = 640 tokens/sec. The per-user TPS is 20. These are very different numbers and a product manager will often want to know both.

The trade-off between them is central to everything that follows. Increasing the batch size (serving more users per forward pass) tends to *increase* system TPS and *decrease* per-user TPS, because each user's forward pass is now sharing compute with more neighbors. Figure 2.4 draws this explicitly.

---

### 2.4: Throughput vs Per-User Latency: The Fundamental Trade-off

![Figure 2.4: Throughput vs per-user latency](figures/ch02-fig4-throughput-vs-latency/final.png)
*Figure 2.4.* Two curves sharing an x-axis (batch size, log-like 1 to 64). One curve rises: **system throughput** (tokens/sec) grows with batch size. The other also rises: **per-user ITL** (ms) grows with batch size. A shaded "sweet spot" around batch 16-32 marks where throughput is high but ITL has not yet collapsed user experience.

Figure 2.4 is the most important plot in inference production after the roofline itself. Look at the two curves carefully.

The deep-lavender curve (system throughput) rises steeply at small batch sizes and plateaus at large batch sizes. This shape is characteristic of **amortization**: loading the model's weights from HBM is a fixed cost paid once per forward pass, and the more tokens that ride along on that single weight-load, the more total tokens the system produces per second. Doubling the batch from 1 to 2 nearly doubles throughput. Doubling from 16 to 32 may increase throughput by only 50%, because the system is approaching the compute ceiling.

The dusty-rose curve (per-user ITL) stays nearly flat at small batch sizes, then rises sharply at large batch sizes. The flat region corresponds to the **memory-bound regime**: as long as the batch fits comfortably in HBM and the forward pass is dominated by weight-loading rather than attention computation, adding more users has almost no effect on per-user latency. Beyond a critical batch size, the system becomes compute-bound and ITL starts to climb.

The shaded "sweet spot" in Figure 2.4, roughly batch size 16 to 32 for most production models on H100, is where both metrics are acceptable. System TPS is high, per-user TPS is still within interactive budgets. Below this range, the GPU is underutilized (and cost-per-token is poor). Above this range, per-user experience degrades.

This is why **picking the right batch size is not a one-time decision**. It depends on your workload (are users patient, or interactive?), your cost constraints (can you afford low utilization?), and your hardware (the ridge point moves with GPU generation). A production inference engineer tunes this parameter continuously, usually via a feedback loop on measured P99 ITL.

A caution: the "batch size" in Figure 2.4 is not a single knob. In a modern serving engine like vLLM, there are **two**: `max_num_seqs` (concurrent sequences) and `max_num_batched_tokens` (total tokens per forward pass). Chapter 19 walks through how those two parameters interact and how to set them. For now, think of "batch size" as the effective concurrency, and remember that throughput and latency are in tension.

---

### 2.5: Percentiles: The Tail You Cannot Afford to Ignore

**P50 latency** is the median, half of all requests are faster than P50, half are slower. **P90** is the 90th percentile, 90% of requests are faster than P90, and the worst 10% are slower. **P99** is the 99th percentile, 99% of requests are faster, and the worst 1% are slower.

In production, **P99 is the number that matters**. Not P50. Not average. P99.

![Figure 2.5: TTFT Distribution Across 1000 Requests](figures/ch02-fig5-percentile-distribution/final.png)
*Figure 2.5.* A histogram of TTFT across 1,000 requests, right-skewed. P50 at 250 ms ("what you brag about"), P90 at 700 ms ("what most users see"), P99 at 2,200 ms ("what wakes the on-call engineer"). The tail is long, P99 is almost 9× the median.

Look at Figure 2.5 carefully. This is a real-looking distribution of TTFTs, a heavy peak near the median, with a long right tail. The peak is the "normal case": most requests land in that fat middle. The tail is the dangerous part: slow requests caused by contention, GC pauses, cold-start effects, long prompts, or simply bad luck.

The three vertical lines show the percentiles. Notice how far apart they are. The P50 (250 ms) is fast, genuinely impressive. The P90 (700 ms) is the number most users actually experience in a typical session, because over ten interactions a user will typically hit one P90-or-worse case. The P99 (2,200 ms) is what a power user who makes a hundred calls per hour will hit multiple times per day. At a P99 of 2.2 seconds, your product feels broken on a regular basis, not to everyone, but to the most engaged users.

#### 2.5.1: Why averaging is wrong

A common mistake is to quote **average latency**. Do not do this. Latency distributions are right-skewed, the tail drags the mean upward, and averages conceal the bimodal structure. A system with a P50 of 200 ms and P99 of 2,000 ms has the same average as a system with P50 of 500 ms and P99 of 800 ms, but the two systems feel entirely different to users.

The rule is simple: in production, **report percentiles, not averages**. Every serving engine's Prometheus / Grafana dashboard exposes P50, P90, P99, and P99.9 for both TTFT and ITL. Look at all of them. If you only look at P50, you are optimizing for the average user who has an above-average experience, which is a meaningful fraction of users, but not the ones who complain.

#### 2.5.2: SLOs are written against P99

Service-level objectives in modern production contracts are written against P99. A typical SLO looks like:

> P99 TTFT < 500 ms, measured over 5-minute windows, 99.9% of the time.

Two percentiles stacked. If your 5-minute P99 is 500 ms, you have met the SLO for that window. If your 5-minute P99 goes above 500 ms, that window breaks SLO. If more than 0.1% of windows break SLO, the contract is violated.

This cascading structure, percentile-of-percentile, is deliberately paranoid. It means that a single slow minute can violate your SLO even if average behavior is fine. It is also why P99 tuning is almost always harder than median tuning: getting the median down is a matter of tuning the common case; getting P99 down is a matter of eliminating *every* source of tail latency.

#### 2.5.3: What causes tail latency in inference

The tail of Figure 2.5 is caused by specific, identifiable phenomena. Each one of them has a chapter in this book:

* **Long-prompt prefill blocking decodes.** A new user's 10K-token prompt lands and the GPU processes it, stalling other users' decodes. Seen directly on every production voice-assistant dashboard I have looked at. Fixed by **chunked prefill** (Chapter 12) and **disaggregated P/D** (Chapter 17).
* **Cache misses for the first token of a session.** A brand-new session has no prefix cache hit, so it pays full prefill. Solved partially by **prefix caching** (Chapter 12).
* **Replica over-commitment.** When `max_num_seqs` is set too high, the forward-pass time grows, and every active user's ITL grows with it. Tuned via the production-serving Chapter 19.
* **Cold starts.** A new replica boots during a traffic spike and its first few requests are slow. Solved with warm-pool maintenance (Chapter 18).
* **Cross-tenant interference.** In multi-tenant serving, one user's long response takes a slot that could have served another user. Solved via SLO-aware routing (Chapter 18).

Every one of these is a P99 problem, not a median problem, and every one of them has its own technique.

### 2.6: Dollars per Million Tokens: The Unit That Decides Viability

The fifth metric is economic. **$/M tokens** is the blended cost of producing 1 million output tokens, accounting for hardware rental, electricity, amortized development time, and whatever idle-capacity overhead you run to meet SLOs.

This is the number your CFO will ask about. It is the number that determines whether your product's unit economics converge. It is also the number that varies most widely across deployment strategies, more than three orders of magnitude, as Figure 2.6 shows.

![Figure 2.6: $ per Million Output Tokens](figures/ch02-fig6-price-per-million-tokens/final.png)
*Figure 2.6.* Seven bars, log-scale X-axis. GPT-5 API at ~$30/M, Claude Sonnet at ~$15/M, Gemini Pro at ~$10/M, Llama-3-70B self-hosted at ~$2/M, Llama-3-8B self-hosted at ~$0.40/M, Llama-3-8B on consumer RTX 4090 at ~$0.10/M, local on M3 Max at essentially $0 (electricity only).

Figure 2.6 tells the story of the single most under-appreciated fact in applied AI. The cheapest serving path (running on hardware you already own) is roughly **three hundred times cheaper** than the most expensive path (a frontier API). Three orders of magnitude. Your choice of deployment strategy can move your per-token cost from $30 to $0.10, with every intermediate point a real trade-off between convenience, quality, and control.

Notice that **the model choice is only one of the variables**. Llama-3-70B self-hosted costs ~$2/M, not because Llama is inherently cheap, but because the serving efficiency (continuous batching, PagedAttention, quantization) is excellent. The same model served naively, with one request per forward pass and no batching, would cost 10× more.

#### 2.6.1: What is in the blended cost

Do not confuse the GPU hourly rate with the per-token cost. An H100 at $2.50/hour can serve anywhere from 5 tokens/sec to 5,000 tokens/sec depending on how it is tuned. The per-token cost is the hourly rate divided by the achieved throughput.

```
$/M tokens  =  (GPU $/hour)  /  (throughput in tokens/sec)  ×  1,000,000 / 3600
            ≈  (GPU $/hour)  /  (tokens/sec)  ×  278
```

At $2.50/hour and 100 tokens/sec (poor utilization), the cost is $2.50 × 278 / 100 = $6.95 / M tokens. At $2.50/hour and 3,000 tokens/sec (well-tuned), the cost is $2.50 × 278 / 3000 = $0.23 / M tokens. **Same hardware, thirty times different cost.** This is why the runtime layer matters economically.

Beyond pure GPU rental, the blended cost should include:

* **Idle-capacity overhead.** To meet SLOs, you run at ~70% average utilization, not 100%. The 30% idle capacity is a real cost, add it to the per-token price. If your replicas run at 70% utilization, multiply the naive cost by 1/0.7 = 1.43.
* **Cold-start and autoscale overhead.** Replicas that boot during traffic spikes serve fewer tokens per hour. This is a 5-15% overhead on most production systems.
* **Observability, logging, and orchestration.** Prometheus, Grafana, the router, the load balancer, the API gateway, small, but real, and usually 2-5% of GPU cost.
* **Amortized development time.** If your inference engineer spent three months tuning the stack and the product serves 100M tokens per day, their time amortizes to roughly $0.01 per million tokens. Tiny compared to GPU cost, but worth naming.

#### 2.6.2: Why APIs cost more

The API providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) charge what Figure 2.6 shows partly because their models are larger and better, but also because their pricing includes margin, SRE overhead, customer support, infrastructure amortization, and the optionality of not paying for idle GPUs. The convenience is real. But the self-hosted path is always cheaper per token for teams that can absorb the engineering overhead, which is the entire premise of this book.

#### 2.6.3: When API cost is acceptable

An API is the right choice when any of the following hold:

* **Your volume is low.** Under 1M tokens/day, even the $30/M API is under $30/day, well below an H100's rental cost.
* **Your quality bar requires a specific frontier model.** No open-source model is indistinguishable from Claude Opus on certain tasks as of 2026, and if your product hinges on that last 5% of capability, pay the premium.
* **Your team has no inference engineer.** Hiring a good inference engineer costs more than many small products' total API budget.
* **You value the vendor's safety tuning.** OpenAI's and Anthropic's RLHF pipelines handle content policy and abuse filtering in ways that take open-source models many months to match.

All other cases, and this is most production cases at any meaningful scale, should self-host. The rest of this book is the skill set that makes self-hosting viable.

## The Metrics Belong to Stakeholders

### 2.7: Who cares about which number

The five metrics are not equally important to everyone in your organization. Figure 2.7 maps metrics to stakeholders.

![Figure 2.7: Who Cares About Which Metric](figures/ch02-fig7-metrics-stakeholder-matrix/final.png)
*Figure 2.7.* A 5 × 5 matrix. Rows are stakeholders (end user, product manager, CFO, DevOps / SRE, researcher). Columns are the five metrics. Filled dots mark primary concerns; lighter dots mark secondary concerns.

Figure 2.7 is the source of most inference-engineering politics. Each row of the matrix represents a human who will enter your one-on-one and tell you that *their* number is the real one. Each of them is correct about their own concern.

**The end user** cares first about TTFT (is anything happening?) and TPS (is it readable?). They do not know what "P99" means; they experience P99 as "this tool is flaky." They do not care about $/M tokens because they are not paying per token, they are paying a subscription. Their experience is a function of TTFT and TPS on their specific sessions, which are drawn randomly from the distribution whose shape is defined by P99.

**The product manager** cares about everything the end user cares about, plus P99 (because user complaints scale with P99), plus $/M tokens (because unit economics determines the company's runway). They will rank TTFT first because they hear user complaints weekly; rank $/M second because they hear board complaints monthly; rank P99 third because that is where the two prior complaints reconcile.

**The CFO** cares almost exclusively about $/M tokens. They will ask you to prove that $/M is trending down, even when traffic is growing. They do not care about ITL unless it is so bad that users churn (which affects revenue, which affects $/M indirectly). A good inference engineer produces a monthly cost trend chart and can explain each inflection point.

**The DevOps / SRE engineer** cares about P99 above all else. P99 is what pages the on-call at 3 AM. P99 is what determines whether your SLO is met and your production bonus is earned. P99 is what the CEO will ask about during an incident post-mortem. The DevOps engineer will fight you on any deployment change that might raise P99 by even a few percent, regardless of how much it improves other metrics.

**The researcher**, whether in-house or external, cares about per-user TPS because that is what papers report in benchmarks. They care about $/M tokens to some degree (funding bodies want cost-efficient research). They do not care about P99 because research code doesn't have SLOs. Be wary of research benchmarks that report only TPS: they are optimized on the assumption that TTFT and P99 do not matter, which is true for offline evaluation and false for production.

Your job as an inference engineer is to see all five numbers as a single coupled system and to refuse to optimize any one of them in isolation. When someone says "just make TTFT faster," the answer is "at what cost to TPS, P99, and $/M?", and then you open Figure 2.4 and make the trade-off concrete.

---

### 2.8: The five numbers in one sentence

Before we close the chapter, let me tell you the one sentence that summarizes the relationship between the five metrics. It is not in Figure 2.7; it is not in any of the earlier sections. It is the mental model I use when I look at any production deployment.

> **TTFT and ITL are coupled through the prefill/decode boundary. TPS is 1/ITL. P99 is the shape of the distribution. $/M is the amortization across all of it.**

Every time you make a change to an inference system, ask what it does to each of the five numbers, and reject changes that help one at disproportionate cost to another. That is the discipline. The rest of this book is the toolkit.

---

### 2.9: Where we go next

We have the map (Chapter 1), and we have the scoreboard (this chapter). What we do not yet have is a physical model of the machine we are optimizing on. Why is decode memory-bound? Why is prefill compute-bound? Why does batching help throughput but hurt ITL? Why does quantization help both?

These are not separate questions. They all collapse onto a single diagram, the **GPU roofline**, which is the subject of Chapter 3. The roofline is the north star of this entire book, and you will return to it in every runtime-layer chapter afterwards. Chapter 3 is where we derive it from first principles, place prefill and decode on it, and see exactly why every technique in this book moves one specific direction on that one chart.

# Chapter 3: The Roofline Is Our North Star

In Chapter 2 we met the five numbers that every inference decision moves. In Chapter 1 we met the three layers that any technique sits on. Both chapters made one implicit promise: there is a single mental model that connects them all. A single diagram that says, for any technique, whether it helps TTFT or ITL, whether it helps compute or bandwidth, whether it improves per-user TPS or system throughput.

That diagram is the **GPU roofline**. It is the most important figure in this book. You will see it again in Chapter 6 (where we derive the GPU hardware numbers that populate it), in Chapter 7 (where the KV cache moves us left on it), in Chapter 10 (where FlashAttention moves us right), in Chapter 13 (where quantization moves the ceiling up), in Chapter 14 (where continuous batching climbs the slope), in Chapter 17 (where disaggregation places prefill and decode on different roofline dots), and in every subsequent runtime-layer chapter. The roofline is how we speak about performance in a way that is grounded in hardware physics rather than hand-waving.

This chapter is where we build it from scratch.

It is a long chapter because it is worth doing carefully. Every minute you spend here will return dividends in every subsequent chapter. If you internalize the roofline now, you will read the rest of this book with a coordinate system in your head, every technique a point, every optimization an arrow, every trade-off a movement on this single plot.

---

## Why We Need a Single Diagram

### 3.1: The question the roofline answers

Take a concrete question. Suppose you are running Llama-3-8B on an H100, and you are considering two optimizations: (a) quantize the weights from FP16 to FP8, or (b) enable FlashAttention. Both are well-known. Both will improve something. Which one improves what?

An engineer who only knows metrics (Chapter 2) might say: both reduce ITL, therefore both improve TPS. Correct, but uninformative. An engineer with a good library (Chapter 1's tooling layer) might say: turn both on, measure. Also correct, but you cannot predict what will happen before the experiment, so you cannot decide whether it is worth running.

The roofline gives you a prediction. It lets you say, in advance:

* Quantization from FP16 to FP8 halves the number of bytes transferred from HBM per token. If you are memory-bound (and for Llama-3-8B decode on H100 you are), this nearly doubles your achievable throughput. It also moves you to a different FLOP ceiling, the FP8 tensor core ceiling is roughly twice the FP16 one, which means you have more compute headroom before you become compute-bound.
* FlashAttention reduces HBM traffic for the attention kernel specifically. For short sequences it changes little because attention is not the dominant memory cost. For long sequences it matters more, because the N×N attention matrix becomes a larger fraction of total bytes.

Both predictions fall out of the roofline automatically. Once you can place your operating point on the roofline and identify the dominant bottleneck, every optimization is an arrow with a known direction.

That is why this chapter is the north star.

---

## Deriving the Roofline from First Principles

### 3.2: Two hard limits on every GPU

Every GPU has exactly two kinds of resources that bound its performance:

1. **Compute throughput**, how many floating-point operations it can execute per second, measured in FLOPs/sec (or tera-FLOPs/sec, TFLOPs).
2. **Memory bandwidth**, how many bytes of data it can transfer from HBM (the big slow pool of memory) to its compute units per second, measured in bytes/sec (or terabytes/sec, TB/s).

For an NVIDIA H100, the rated numbers are:

| Resource | Value |
| --- | --- |
| FP32 compute (CUDA cores) | 67 TFLOPs/sec |
| FP16 compute (Tensor cores) | 989 TFLOPs/sec |
| FP8 compute (Tensor cores) | 1,979 TFLOPs/sec |
| INT4 compute (Tensor cores) | 3,958 TFLOPs/sec |
| HBM bandwidth | 3.35 TB/sec |

Two observations. First, there is not *one* compute ceiling, there are several, depending on precision. If your kernel runs in FP16, you get up to 989 TFLOPs. If it runs in FP8, you get up to 1,979 TFLOPs. This is the first hint of why quantization (Chapter 13) is so powerful: it does not just save bytes, it moves you to a higher compute ceiling.

Second, both resources are *fixed* per-GPU. You cannot magically get more bandwidth out of an H100, it is wired into the silicon. This is important. It means that the GPU's theoretical peak performance for any workload is **whichever of these two limits you hit first**.

Which one you hit first is determined by a single ratio: how many FLOPs does your workload perform *per byte of data it reads from memory*? That ratio has a name.

### 3.3: Arithmetic intensity: the one number that explains everything

**Arithmetic intensity** (denoted AI) is:

```
AI  =  FLOPs performed by the kernel  /  Bytes transferred from HBM
```

AI is measured in FLOPs per byte. It is a property of the *kernel*, not the hardware. Every matmul, every attention computation, every softmax has its own arithmetic intensity. An AI of 1 means one floating-point operation per byte of data. An AI of 1,000 means a thousand floating-point operations per byte.

Why does this number matter? Because it tells you which of the two hardware limits you will hit first.

Consider a kernel with AI = 1. Every byte it reads triggers one FLOP. If the GPU has a bandwidth of 3.35 TB/sec, the kernel can read 3.35 trillion bytes per second, which means it can do 3.35 trillion FLOPs per second, i.e., 3.35 TFLOPs. Even though the H100 *can* do 989 TFLOPs in FP16, this kernel will never get above 3.35 TFLOPs because there are not enough bytes per second flowing in to feed more compute. This kernel is **memory-bound**. The bottleneck is not the compute units (which sit idle most of the time) but the memory pipe.

Now consider a kernel with AI = 1,000. Every byte triggers a thousand FLOPs. The 3.35 TB/sec of bandwidth now supports 3.35 × 1,000 = 3,350 TFLOPs, well above the H100's FP16 ceiling of 989 TFLOPs. The hardware cannot actually do 3,350 TFLOPs; it is capped at 989. So this kernel is **compute-bound**. The bottleneck is the compute units; the memory pipe is never saturated.

The transition point, where the kernel's AI is just high enough to saturate the compute ceiling, is called the **ridge point**. For H100 in FP16:

```
ridge AI  =  989 TFLOPs/sec  /  3.35 TB/sec  =  295 FLOPs per byte
```

Any kernel with AI below 295 is memory-bound on H100. Any kernel with AI above 295 is compute-bound.

Every technique in this book, at its deepest level, is an attempt to either (a) push an operating point across the ridge toward compute-bound territory, or (b) raise the ceiling that we bump our head against once we get there.

---

### 3.4: The plot itself

Now we can draw it.

![Figure 3.1: The GPU Roofline](figures/ch03-fig1-roofline-anchor/final.png)
*Figure 3.1.* The anchor diagram. X-axis: arithmetic intensity (log scale, FLOPs per byte). Y-axis: achieved FLOPs per second (log scale). A diagonal line rising at slope 1 on the log-log plot, the **memory bandwidth ceiling**. A horizontal flat line, the **compute ceiling**. The two meet at the **ridge point**. The shaded region to the left of the ridge is memory-bound; to the right, compute-bound.

Figure 3.1 is the diagram you will see in this book more often than any other. Look at it carefully, because every subsequent figure in every runtime chapter is some variation of it.

The diagonal line on the left is the bandwidth ceiling. Its slope on a log-log plot is exactly 1, because `achieved_FLOPs = AI × bandwidth`, which is linear in AI. Double your arithmetic intensity, and your achievable FLOP rate doubles, as long as you stay below the ridge.

The horizontal flat line on top is the compute ceiling. Its value is whatever the hardware's peak FLOP throughput is in the precision you are using. For H100 FP16, that is 989 TFLOPs. Above the ridge, your achievable throughput is capped at this value no matter how much AI you have.

The ridge point is where the two meet. Kernels at the ridge are using *both* resources fully, every byte of bandwidth is feeding enough FLOPs to saturate compute, and every FLOP is finding a byte of data ready to work on. This is the sweet spot.

Now, a critical question: **where do real LLM inference kernels sit on this plot?**

---

### 3.5: Where prefill and decode actually sit

Prefill and decode are not on the same part of the roofline. They are in completely different regimes, and understanding *why* is the single most important insight in all of inference engineering.

![Figure 3.2: Prefill vs Decode on the Roofline](figures/ch03-fig2-prefill-vs-decode-on-roofline/final.png)
*Figure 3.2.* Two labeled operating points. **Prefill** sits in the compute-bound region near the flat ceiling, at AI ≈ 100. **Decode (batch=1)** sits deep in the memory-bound region, at AI ≈ 1. An arc arrow connects them with the caption "they are fundamentally different workloads."

The two dots in Figure 3.2 are not graphical decoration. They are computed from first principles, and we will now compute them together.

#### 3.5.1: Prefill's arithmetic intensity

During prefill, the model processes *all N input tokens at once* through a single forward pass. The dominant operation is the matrix-matrix multiplication `X · W_Q` (and the analogous K and V projections), where X is `(N, d)` and W\_Q is `(d, d)`.

For one such projection:

```
FLOPs = 2 × N × d × d = 2Nd²         (two FLOPs per multiply-add)
Bytes = 2 × (N × d) + 2 × (d × d) + 2 × (N × d)    (X in, W_Q in, output out, FP16)
      = 4Nd + 2d²
```

Arithmetic intensity:

```
AI_prefill  =  2Nd² / (4Nd + 2d²)
             =  Nd / (2N + d)
             ≈  d / 2                (when N is large, the Nd term dominates)
```

For Llama-3-8B with `d = 4096` and a typical prompt length `N = 2048`:

```
AI_prefill ≈ 4096 × 2048 / (2 × 2048 + 4096) = 8,388,608 / 8,192 ≈ 1,024
```

**1,024 FLOPs per byte.** Well above the ridge point of 295. Prefill is deeply compute-bound.

This is why the prefill dot in Figure 3.2 sits near the top of the roofline, against the compute ceiling. When you increase prompt length, `AI_prefill` stays large, prefill does not become memory-bound for any realistic prompt. The constraint is FLOP throughput.

#### 3.5.2: Decode's arithmetic intensity

During decode, the model produces exactly **one new token per forward pass**. The input is a single token's embedding vector of shape `(1, d)`, and the same weight matrix `W_Q` of shape `(d, d)` is loaded from HBM.

```
FLOPs = 2 × 1 × d × d = 2d²
Bytes = 2 × (1 × d) + 2 × (d × d) + 2 × (1 × d)
      = 4d + 2d²
      ≈ 2d²                           (the d² term dominates)
```

Arithmetic intensity:

```
AI_decode  ≈  2d² / 2d² = 1
```

**Arithmetic intensity of approximately 1.** This is the root cause of every inference engineering problem in this book. At AI ≈ 1, the decode operating point is deep in the memory-bound region of the roofline, far below the ridge, far below the compute ceiling.

For H100 at bandwidth 3.35 TB/sec:

```
achieved_decode_FLOPs  =  AI × bandwidth  =  1 × 3.35 TB/sec  ≈  3.35 TFLOPs/sec
```

But the H100 *could* do 989 TFLOPs in FP16. We are using **0.34% of the GPU's compute capacity**. The other 99.66% of the compute units are sitting idle, waiting for data to arrive from HBM.

Now you understand the dark secret of LLM inference in 2026: **every decode step on an unoptimized single-sequence stack uses less than 1% of the GPU it runs on.** The entire runtime layer of this book exists to close that gap.

#### 3.5.3: Why the two dots are so far apart

Prefill processes N tokens per forward pass. It loads the weights once and does N times more FLOPs per byte. Decode processes 1 token per forward pass. It loads the same weights and does only a handful of FLOPs per byte.

The asymmetry is fundamental. It is not a bug we can fix; it is a property of autoregressive generation. Every token depends on the previous one, so we cannot parallelize across output tokens the way we can across input tokens.

What we *can* do is move the decode dot to the right, increase its AI, by various tricks that all boil down to "get more useful work out of each weight-load." And we can lift the compute ceiling upward by quantization.

Figure 3.3 shows, at a glance, what each runtime-layer technique does.

---

### 3.6: Where each optimization moves you

![Figure 3.3: Where each optimization moves you on the roofline](figures/ch03-fig3-optimizations-on-roofline/final.png)
*Figure 3.3.* A baseline decode dot, with three color-coded arrows indicating directions of movement, and a legend card on the side. **Right:** FlashAttention, MLA, MQA, GQA, Prefix Caching, reduce bytes transferred, raise AI. **Up:** Quantization (FP8, INT4), new higher ceiling on quantized tensor cores. **Up-right:** Continuous batching, more tokens per HBM load.

This is the map. Every runtime-layer technique in this book moves you in one of three directions.

**Right, raise AI by reducing bytes per token.** This is the largest category. FlashAttention eliminates the N×N attention score matrix from HBM entirely, so the bytes-per-token drop. MLA/MQA/GQA shrink the KV cache, so fewer bytes must be read from HBM during decode. Prefix caching avoids reading K and V for prompt tokens that were already processed by another user. Every one of these techniques does not change *what* the model computes, it changes *how many bytes* must travel through the HBM pipe to compute it. The result is a higher AI per decode step, which moves the operating point right on the roofline, closer to the ridge.

**Up, raise the ceiling by using lower-precision compute.** Quantization to FP8 moves you from the 989 TFLOPs ceiling to the 1,979 TFLOPs ceiling. Quantization to INT4 moves you to the 3,958 TFLOPs ceiling. If you are compute-bound (prefill, or well-batched decode), this directly doubles or quadruples your throughput. If you are memory-bound (decode at batch 1), this *also* reduces bytes per weight, because a weight stored in FP8 takes half the bytes of the same weight stored in FP16, so quantization combines a byte reduction and a ceiling lift. It moves you both right *and* up.

**Up-right, amortize weight-loads across more users.** Continuous batching packs decode steps from many users into the same forward pass. The weights are loaded from HBM once, and every batched user "rides along" on that one load. If you go from batch 1 to batch 32, you have amortized the weight-load 32-fold. AI effectively multiplies by 32. The operating point climbs the slope toward the ridge. This is what Figure 3.4 shows explicitly.

Every subsequent runtime chapter in this book can be read as a detailed treatment of one of these three arrows. Read Figure 3.3 now; you will keep it in your head for the rest of the book.

---

### 3.7: The two separate ceilings

We mentioned in §3.2 that there is more than one compute ceiling. The H100 has at least four, depending on precision. Figure 3.4 shows them stacked.

![Figure 3.4: Two Separate Ceilings (FP32, FP16, FP8, INT4)](figures/ch03-fig4-two-separate-ceilings/final.png)
*Figure 3.4.* A stepped ceiling, each step higher than the last. FP32 CUDA core ceiling at 67 TFLOPs. FP16 Tensor core ceiling at 989 TFLOPs (14× higher). FP8 ceiling at 1,979 TFLOPs (29× higher). INT4 ceiling at 3,958 TFLOPs (59× higher). Quantization moves you to a higher shelf.

Figure 3.4 makes the quantization story concrete. When someone says "FP8 is twice as fast as FP16," they mean: the ceiling lifts by 2×, and if you are compute-bound, your achievable throughput doubles. If you are memory-bound, you get a further 2× from the halved bytes-per-weight. Quantization is the one optimization that wins in *both* regimes.

Crucially, these ceilings are **not software-achievable on any kernel**. They are only reached by Tensor-core kernels written specifically for each precision. A naive PyTorch `@ W` in FP16 does not reach 989 TFLOPs; it reaches 40% of that. Reaching the ceiling requires FlashAttention-style hand-tuned CUDA, or TensorRT-LLM's compiled kernels, or specialized libraries like cuBLAS-Lt. This is why the tooling layer matters for realizing the ceiling gain, you cannot just "use FP8" and expect the full 2× speedup unless your serving engine supports FP8 tensor core kernels. vLLM, SGLang, and TensorRT-LLM all do as of 2026; older stacks may not.

---

### 3.8: Batched decode climbs the roofline

If you remember one thing from this chapter, one mechanical fact, let it be this: **batching is what moves decode from memory-bound toward compute-bound.**

![Figure 3.5: Batched Decode Climbs the Roofline](figures/ch03-fig5-batched-decode-climbs/final.png)
*Figure 3.5.* Four operating points connected by a rising arrow. Batch 1: AI ≈ 1. Batch 4: AI ≈ 4. Batch 16: AI ≈ 16. Batch 64: AI ≈ 64, hitting the ridge. The arrow labeled "more tokens per HBM load, AI grows linearly with batch size."

At batch size 1, decode loads the full model's weights from HBM to produce one token. AI ≈ 1.

At batch size 32, decode loads the full model's weights from HBM to produce 32 tokens (one per active user, all in the same forward pass). AI ≈ 32.

Arithmetic intensity is multiplied directly by the batch size. This is because the weights are the dominant byte cost, and they are loaded once per forward pass regardless of how many users the batch contains. The operating point in Figure 3.5 climbs the memory-bandwidth slope at a 1:1 rate with log(batch size) on the log-log plot.

Somewhere between batch 16 and batch 64, for Llama-3-8B on H100, the operating point hits the ridge. At that point, decode is compute-bound: the GPU is saturated. Beyond that, adding more users does *not* increase per-GPU throughput further, it just forces them to wait their turn for compute slots, which increases per-user ITL.

This is the mechanism behind Figure 2.4 (throughput vs per-user latency). Below the ridge, increasing batch size increases throughput with negligible effect on ITL (you are still memory-bound; adding users does not make the weight-load any slower). Above the ridge, increasing batch size increases throughput at the cost of linearly increasing ITL. **The ridge is the sweet spot.**

Real production systems live just below the ridge. You set `max_num_seqs` to whatever value keeps your median operating point at batch ~16-32, because that is where the roofline is most efficient. Chapter 14 (continuous batching) and Chapter 19 (vLLM internals) are where this tuning happens in practice.

---

### 3.9: Deriving arithmetic intensity for attention, explicitly

We have been handwaving a bit. Let us derive AI for the attention kernel explicitly, so you can do this calculation yourself for any new technique.

![Figure 3.6: Deriving Arithmetic Intensity for Attention](figures/ch03-fig6-arithmetic-intensity-derivation/final.png)
*Figure 3.6.* Left column: a five-step math derivation. Right column: a labeled schematic of the Q, K, V, softmax, output matrices. The final formula: `AI = N × d / (H × D)` for an attention forward pass with `N` tokens, `d` model dimension, `H` heads, `D` head dimension.

The derivation in Figure 3.6 follows the standard pattern for any kernel:

**Step 1.** Identify the operation. Attention forward is `softmax(Q · Kᵀ / √d) · V`. We care about the dominant matrix multiplications: `Q · Kᵀ` (scores) and `weights · V` (context).

**Step 2.** Count FLOPs. The scores matrix has shape `(N, N)` and each cell is a dot product of dimension `d`, so `FLOPs_scores = 2 × N × N × d = 2N²d`. The context matrix has shape `(N, d)` and each cell is a dot product of dimension `N`, so `FLOPs_context = 2 × N × d × N = 2N²d`. Total: `FLOPs = 4N²d`.

**Step 3.** Count bytes. During decode, the dominant byte cost is reading the K and V caches from HBM. Each cache has shape `(N, H, D)` where `H` is the number of heads and `D = d/H` is the head dimension. Total K and V together: `2 × N × H × D × 2 bytes (FP16) = 4NHD`.

**Step 4.** Compute AI:

```
AI_attention  =  4N²d  /  4NHD  =  Nd / HD
```

Since `d = H × D`, this simplifies to `AI_attention = N × H × D / (H × D) = N`.

**Step 5.** Evaluate for Llama-3-8B at `N = 4096`, `d = 4096`, `H = 32`, `D = 128`:

```
AI_attention  =  4096 × 4096 / (32 × 128)  =  16,777,216 / 4,096  =  4,096
```

Attention decode has AI ≈ 4096. That is far above the ridge, attention itself is compute-bound during decode!

This is surprising. It means the attention operation is **not** the memory-bound bottleneck. The bottleneck is the projection matmuls (Q/K/V projections and output projection) and the FFN, which have AI ≈ 1 during decode. The reason is that the K/V cache is small per-token, but the weights of the projections are large and must be reloaded every forward pass.

This is exactly why MLA (Chapter 8) helps so much. MLA shrinks the KV cache but the attention operation was never the bottleneck anyway. The real win of MLA comes from an auxiliary effect: with a smaller cache, you can fit more concurrent sequences in HBM, which lets you raise the batch size, which moves you up the roofline slope.

Every technique in this book has a similar layered analysis. The roofline is what lets you do it without confusion.

---

### 3.10: The chef and the delivery truck: the analogy that sticks

If everything above was math-heavy, this section is the human metaphor that makes the roofline stick.

![Figure 3.7: The Chef and the Delivery Truck](figures/ch03-fig7-chef-truck-analogy/final.png)
*Figure 3.7.* Two panels. On the left, a chef at a stove labeled "COMPUTE, infinite capacity to cook, if ingredients arrive." On the right, a small truck labeled "MEMORY BANDWIDTH, limited supply road, only so many ingredients per second." Arrows between them show ingredients flowing along the road. Caption at the bottom: "Decode = a fast chef waiting on a slow truck. Prefill = a crowd of chefs working on a big delivery that just arrived."

The metaphor is this. The GPU has two resources: lots of chefs (compute units), and one narrow delivery road (HBM bandwidth). Every dish the chefs cook requires ingredients. The ingredients must travel the road.

A **memory-bound kernel** is when the chefs are faster than the road. They stand idle most of the time, waiting for ingredients to arrive. It does not matter how many chefs you hire, if the road is narrow, you cook at the road's speed, not the kitchen's.

A **compute-bound kernel** is when the chefs are slower than the road. Ingredients pile up at the door faster than anyone can cook them. Now the bottleneck is the chefs, and you could benefit from hiring more.

The ridge is exactly the sweet spot where the road delivers ingredients at the same rate the chefs consume them. Neither the road nor the kitchen is idle. The whole operation is balanced.

The runtime-layer techniques in this book are ways to make the kitchen busier without hiring more chefs:

* **FlashAttention** keeps more of the cooking local, it lets chefs reuse ingredients they already have on the counter, without sending them back to the warehouse and re-ordering them.
* **MLA / MQA / GQA** makes the ingredients smaller, less volume of product flowing down the road per dish.
* **Quantization** upgrades the chefs, the same kitchen can now cook twice as fast per dish (lower-precision tensor cores), and every ingredient also weighs half as much (half the bytes per weight).
* **Continuous batching** batches orders so one truckload serves many diners instead of one, the road still delivers at the same rate, but each delivery now produces more meals.

Keep this metaphor when you are tired. The math is above; the intuition is here.

## How to Use the Roofline in Practice

### 3.11: The workflow: measure, place, predict

The roofline is not a proof; it is a *tool*. In practice, here is how an inference engineer uses it to diagnose a system.

**Step 1. Measure AI on your actual workload.** Most profilers (NVIDIA Nsight, PyTorch profiler, or just custom instrumentation) can tell you FLOPs performed and bytes transferred per forward pass. Divide. You get the AI of your decode kernel, which on most unoptimized stacks will land near 1.

**Step 2. Plot your operating point.** Put a dot on Figure 3.1 at your measured AI. If it is to the left of the ridge, you are memory-bound. If it is to the right, you are compute-bound.

**Step 3. Predict the effect of any proposed change.** For each candidate optimization:

* Does it move right (raise AI)? By how much? Multiply current AI by the expected ratio; the new dot sits there.
* Does it move up (raise ceiling)? By how much? This only helps if you are already compute-bound, or if the move-right gets you to the ridge.
* Does it do both (quantization)? Combine both movements.

**Step 4. Rank optimizations by expected movement.** An optimization that doubles AI from 1 to 2 (while you are memory-bound) doubles your throughput. An optimization that raises the ceiling when you are memory-bound does nothing. Do not ship anything without a roofline prediction.

**Step 5. Measure after the change.** Compare predicted dot to actual dot. Discrepancies are where you learn what your model of the system was missing, usually some second-order effect like cache contention, kernel launch overhead, or synchronization cost.

In the rest of this book, every runtime chapter ends with a "where this lands on the roofline" paragraph. That is the discipline of always answering Step 3 in writing. When you read Chapter 7 (KV cache) or Chapter 10 (FlashAttention) or Chapter 13 (quantization), you will find each technique accompanied by a specific prediction of how the operating point moves. Test yourself: before reading the prediction, try to make it yourself from first principles. If you can do this consistently, you are thinking like an inference engineer.

---

### 3.12: What the roofline does not tell you

No mental model is complete. The roofline is powerful because it captures the first-order behavior of GPU kernels. It is also imperfect. Here are the things it does not model.

**Kernel launch overhead.** Every forward pass has a fixed cost of a few hundred microseconds for scheduling the kernels, synchronizing streams, and copying small tensors. At very small batches this overhead dominates, and the roofline underpredicts how much time you actually spend. This is why CUDA graphs (pre-captured kernel sequences) help so much at batch 1, they amortize the launch overhead to nearly zero.

**Cache effects (L1, L2).** The roofline treats memory as "HBM or not HBM." Real GPUs have an L2 cache (50 MB on H100) and per-SM SRAM (228 KB on H100) that sit between HBM and compute. A well-written kernel can hit the L2 for a meaningful fraction of its reads, which effectively increases bandwidth for that kernel. FlashAttention exploits exactly this: it tiles the computation so the N×N attention matrix lives in SRAM, never touching HBM. The roofline treats this as an AI change, which is approximately correct but loses the hierarchy detail.

**Kernel-specific ceilings below the published peak.** Real kernels rarely hit the published FLOP ceiling. A hand-tuned cuBLAS matmul will reach ~85-92% of peak. A naive PyTorch kernel will reach ~30-50% of peak. The "ceiling" we draw in Figure 3.1 should really be adjusted downward to the kernel's realistic peak, say, 800 TFLOPs for a well-tuned FP16 kernel on H100, not 989.

**Asynchronous memory copies.** H100's TMA (Tensor Memory Accelerator) allows weight-loading to overlap with compute. If you are using it well, the "bandwidth" ceiling is effectively higher than the rated 3.35 TB/sec, because you are pipelining. FlashAttention-3 was specifically designed to exploit this.

**Multi-GPU communication.** Once you have more than one GPU, AllReduce overhead enters the picture. The roofline of a single GPU does not model inter-GPU communication. Chapter 16 builds a separate model for that layer.

All of these caveats are second-order. For first-order reasoning, "will this optimization help or hurt?", the simple roofline is all you need.

---

### 3.13: The north star of every subsequent chapter

You now have the north star. Every runtime-layer chapter from Chapter 7 onward will end with a "place on the roofline" statement. The statement will name the direction (right / up / up-right), the expected magnitude (factor of 2, factor of 10), and the dependency (which other conditions must be true for the movement to materialize).

Chapter 7, KV Cache, places decode deep in the memory-bound region after the cache is enabled, and derives why. The cache reduces FLOPs per token but leaves bytes unchanged, so AI drops. The dot moves *left*, further into memory-bound territory. This is the "dark side of the KV cache" we foreshadow in Chapter 7 and spend the next six chapters fixing.

Chapter 10, FlashAttention, moves the decode dot to the *right*, raising AI by eliminating HBM traffic for the N×N attention matrix. The exact magnitude depends on sequence length; longer sequences see bigger gains.

Chapter 13, Quantization, moves the ceiling *up* (bigger TFLOPs ceiling in FP8/INT4) *and* raises AI (half/quarter the bytes per weight). The decode dot moves up-and-right.

Chapter 14, Continuous batching, climbs the *slope*. Throughput rises until you hit the ridge.

Chapter 17, Disaggregated P/D, separates the two dots from Figure 3.2 onto *different hardware*. The prefill dot now sits on a compute-optimized GPU; the decode dot sits on a memory-bandwidth-optimized one. The roofline splits in two.

Every one of these chapters builds on Figure 3.1. That is why this chapter comes third in the book. Once you have it, everything that follows fits into it.

---

### 3.14: Where we go next

We have been talking about inference as if training were a solved problem that never happened. But inference is half of a pipeline, and the other half, pre-training, shapes everything we do. Before we dive into the specific techniques, we need one more foundation: a clear picture of what pre-training actually does, how it differs from inference, and why that difference is the reason this book exists.

Chapter 4 is a one-page recap of pre-training, just enough that the "naive inference" chapter that follows can make sense. If you have a PhD in ML, you can skim it. If you do not, read it carefully; it is the ground on which Chapter 5's redundancy argument stands.

# Chapter 4: Pre-Training in One Page

Chapter 3 gave us the coordinate system, the GPU roofline, on which every inference technique in the book will be placed. Before we can talk about the techniques themselves, we need to talk about *what the model is doing* when it runs. That means talking about how the model was trained.

This chapter is a deliberate detour. It is the shortest chapter in the book, and it is not a complete treatment of pre-training, other books have hundreds of pages on this topic. The job here is narrower: to establish the specific facts about pre-training that make "inference" a meaningful and distinct subject.

If you have a PhD in ML, skim this chapter, the material is elementary. If you have used an LLM API but never trained one yourself, read it carefully. Every claim we make about inference in Chapter 5 is going to rest on these facts.

---

## Why We Need This Detour

### 4.1: The key claim this chapter establishes

An inference engineer is not a training engineer. The two disciplines share the same model architecture (transformer decoder), the same weights, and the same math primitive (matrix multiplication). Everything else is different. The batching is different. The loss is different. The hardware configuration is different. The optimization objectives are different. The bottlenecks are different.

More precisely: **training and inference are the same transformer forward pass, but with opposite input shapes and opposite cost structures.** Training uses big batches of long sequences with a loss function at the end; inference uses small batches of single tokens with a sampling function at the end. Training is compute-bound and runs for months at a time; inference is memory-bound and must respond in milliseconds.

This chapter's job is to make that claim precise. Once we understand exactly what training does, Chapter 5 can cleanly show what "naive inference" is (just training's forward pass, but one token at a time), and why it is wasteful, and what has to change.

---

## The Pre-Training Loop, Step by Step

### 4.2: The loop, in one picture

Figure 4.1 is the whole thing.

![Figure 4.1: The Pre-Training Loop](figures/ch04-fig1-pretraining-loop/final.png)
*Figure 4.1.* A flow diagram with eight stages: training corpus (tokens), tokenizer, batch (B sequences of length N), transformer forward pass (L layers), logits (B × N × V), cross-entropy loss vs. shifted targets, backward pass (autograd), AdamW optimizer step. A loop returns from optimizer step back to forward pass. The label on the loop: "repeat for trillions of tokens."

The loop in Figure 4.1 runs continuously for the duration of pre-training. In 2026, pre-training a 70B-parameter frontier model takes roughly 2 million GPU-hours across a cluster of 4,000 to 16,000 H100-class GPUs for roughly 2-3 months of wall-clock time. The loop iterates billions of times. Every iteration consumes one *batch*, typically 2 million to 16 million tokens in aggregate, and adjusts the weights a tiny amount based on how well the model predicts the next token at every position.

Notice what is in Figure 4.1 and what is not. The *forward pass* is in there (stage 4), and it is the same forward pass that inference will use. The *backward pass* and the *optimizer step* are in there (stages 7 and 8), and those are what distinguishes training from inference, they compute gradients and update weights. The *data pipeline* is in there (stages 1-3), and it is what feeds the GPU. At no point in the loop is there any notion of "serving a user" or "streaming a response." Training is a closed loop. No one is listening.

Inference is what happens after training stops: the weights are frozen, the loop is gone, and a *different* system takes over whose job is to use those frozen weights to respond to users in real time. **No more gradients. No more updates. Just one frozen forward pass, called over and over.**

That difference, gradients and updates on one side, frozen weights on the other, is the whole reason inference engineering is a separate discipline.

### 4.3: What the model is actually predicting: shift-by-one

Before we talk about the forward pass itself, we need to be precise about what the model is being trained to *do*. There is one and only one objective: **predict the next token**. Given any prefix of a sentence, predict what word comes next.

Figure 4.2 shows how this is implemented.

![Figure 4.2: Next-Token Prediction = Shift by One](figures/ch04-fig2-next-token-shift/final.png)
*Figure 4.2.* Two horizontal strips of tokens. Input X: [The, cat, sat, on, the]. Target Y (input shifted left by one): [cat, sat, on, the, mat]. A light arrow from each input token down to the corresponding target. Right side: for position i=2 (input "sat"), the model sees [The, cat, sat] and must predict "on."

The trick in Figure 4.2 is simple. If your training corpus is the sentence "The cat sat on the mat," you construct two token sequences: the input X = [The, cat, sat, on, the] and the target Y = [cat, sat, on, the, mat]. The target is X shifted left by one position.

The model then processes X in parallel (all 5 positions at once, which is the point of the transformer architecture) and produces 5 predictions, one per position. At position 0, it sees [The] and is asked to predict "cat". At position 1, it sees [The, cat] and is asked to predict "sat". At position 2, it sees [The, cat, sat] and is asked to predict "on". At position 3, [The, cat, sat, on] → "the". At position 4, [The, cat, sat, on, the] → "mat".

This is called **teacher forcing**. Every position's prediction is conditioned on the true input up to that point, not on the model's own previous prediction. Teacher forcing is what lets us parallelize training across positions: all 5 predictions happen in one forward pass, because each one depends only on the true input tokens (which we already have).

At inference time, we lose this property. At inference, the model has to condition on its own previous output, because we do not have the "true" next token, that is what the model is supposed to produce. This is the root cause of autoregressive decoding's sequential nature. Chapter 5 will walk through this in detail.

---

### 4.4: Batching during training vs inference

Training runs at very large batch sizes. Inference runs at very small batch sizes. Figure 4.3 shows why this asymmetry exists.

![Figure 4.3: Batching During Training vs Decode](figures/ch04-fig3-batching-training/final.png)
*Figure 4.3.* Left half: eight sequences (batch = 8) fed into one transformer forward pass, all sequences processed in parallel. Label: "TRAINING, big batches amortize forward/backward cost." Right half: a single token (batch = 1 typical) fed into a forward pass that produces one output token. Label: "INFERENCE DECODE, tiny batches, memory-bound."

The left half of Figure 4.3 shows what a training forward pass looks like. A batch of, say, 8 sequences, each of length 2048 tokens, is assembled into a single tensor of shape `(8, 2048, d)`. The tensor is pushed through the transformer. Every position of every sequence produces a prediction. The loss is averaged across all `8 × 2048 = 16,384` positions. One gradient update is computed per batch.

The right half of Figure 4.3 shows what decode looks like. One token at a time, `(1, 1, d)`, is pushed through the transformer, which produces one next-token prediction. If we are serving many users in parallel, we might batch `k` of them together for a given forward pass, producing `k` predictions per step. But `k` is usually 1 to 32, not 8,192, because the sequences are independent and typically active on different physical requests.

The asymmetry has two consequences we care about:

**First, training is compute-bound, inference (decode) is memory-bound.** This is the exact distinction we derived in Chapter 3 using the roofline. Training's batch size is large enough to push arithmetic intensity well above the ridge; decode's batch size is small enough to leave it well below. Same model, same hardware, opposite regimes.

**Second, training's constant-factor throughput is far higher than decode's.** A training cluster on H100s might push 2-3 million tokens per second per GPU (via FlashAttention-3 and optimal batch sizes). A decode stack on the same H100s pushes ~3,000 to 6,000 tokens per second per GPU. The 400× gap is entirely because training processes many tokens per weight-load, while decode processes one. The GPU hardware is identical; the workload is not.

This also explains why **the same company that trains a model cares deeply about inference costs**. Training was a capital expense paid once. Inference is an operational expense paid forever. Over a model's lifetime, inference compute usually exceeds training compute by a factor of 10× to 100×. Getting inference right is, economically, the bigger problem.

---

### 4.5: The loss function, once

What connects the forward pass to a gradient update is the loss function. Figure 4.4 walks through it.

![Figure 4.4: Cross-Entropy Loss on the Vocabulary](figures/ch04-fig4-cross-entropy-loss/final.png)
*Figure 4.4.* Four-stage diagram. Stage 1: raw logits (real-valued scores over vocab V=8, e.g., 1.2, -0.4, 3.1, 0.8, ...). Stage 2: softmax probabilities (summing to 1; the cell for "mat" highlighted at 0.58). Stage 3: one-hot target vector (1 only at the "mat" position). Stage 4: loss = −log(0.58) = 0.54.

Cross-entropy loss has four conceptual steps:

**Logits.** The forward pass produces a real-valued vector of length V (the vocabulary size, typically 32,000 to 200,000 for modern LLMs). Each entry is the unnormalized score the model assigns to that vocab token being the next one. Logits are unconstrained, they can be any real number, positive or negative.

**Softmax.** Exponentiate each logit and normalize so the vector sums to 1. This converts the logits into a probability distribution over the vocabulary. The token with the highest logit gets the highest probability.

**Target.** The true next token (from the shifted target Y in Figure 4.2) is represented as a one-hot vector: 1 at its position in the vocab, 0 everywhere else.

**Loss.** Cross-entropy loss against a one-hot target simplifies to `−log(p_target)`, where `p_target` is the probability the model assigned to the true token. If the model assigned probability 1.0 to the true token (perfect prediction), the loss is 0. If it assigned 0.58 (the example in Figure 4.4), the loss is 0.54. If it assigned near-zero, the loss blows up to infinity.

Gradients then flow backward from this loss through the transformer's layers (the backward pass in Figure 4.1, stage 7) and AdamW updates every weight in the model by a tiny step in the direction that would have reduced the loss (stage 8). Then a new batch arrives, and the loop repeats.

**At inference time, none of this happens.** No loss, no gradients, no updates. We run the forward pass up to the point where logits are produced. Then, instead of comparing them to a target, we *sample* from them, pick a token according to the probability distribution, and emit it to the user. Chapter 5 will walk through what exactly the forward pass looks like during inference.

---

### 4.6: Training FLOPs vs inference FLOPs: the 3× rule

Here is a fact that every inference engineer should carry in their head.

![Figure 4.5: A Training FLOP Is ~3× an Inference FLOP](figures/ch04-fig5-training-vs-inference-flops/final.png)
*Figure 4.5.* Two grouped bars. Left group (training step): forward = 1 unit, backward = 2 units, total = 3 units. Right group (inference decode): forward only = 1 unit. Equation box: training FLOPs ≈ 6 × parameters × training tokens. Inference FLOPs ≈ 2 × parameters × tokens generated.

A training step executes three "forward-equivalent" passes:

1. **Forward pass.** Cost: 1 unit (2 FLOPs per parameter per token).
2. **Backward pass.** Cost: 2 units (computes gradient of loss w.r.t. each weight, roughly twice the forward-pass work).
3. **Optimizer step.** Cost: small, usually negligible.

Total training cost per token per parameter: **6 FLOPs**. This is the famous "6× rule" in LLM compute budgets. The aggregate cost to pre-train a model is:

```
Training FLOPs  ≈  6 × parameters × training tokens
```

For GPT-3 (175B parameters, trained on ~500B tokens): `6 × 175e9 × 500e9 = 5.25 × 10²³ FLOPs`. At the time (2020), this was roughly 355 V100-years. Today, on H100s, it would be about 26 GPU-years, which is the kind of compute a frontier lab provisions for a single model.

By contrast, an inference step is **forward only**:

```
Inference FLOPs  ≈  2 × parameters × tokens generated
```

For Llama-3-8B generating 100 tokens: `2 × 8e9 × 100 = 1.6 × 10¹² FLOPs`. At H100's 989 FP16 TFLOPs, that is 1.6 milliseconds of pure compute, completely trivial. Of course, the *actual* decode time is dominated by memory bandwidth (Chapter 3), not compute, so the number above is misleading in practice. It does, however, correctly answer: "how much theoretical work does the model do at inference?"

The 3:1 ratio is the reason why a well-optimized inference stack can, per H100, serve orders of magnitude more tokens-per-second than a training cluster can produce. The training cluster is doing 3× the FLOPs and running near the compute ceiling. The inference stack is doing 1× the FLOPs and, with good engineering, climbing the bandwidth slope. Different regimes, different math, different bottlenecks.

---

## What This All Means for Inference

### 4.7: The three facts we carry forward

Boil this chapter down and three facts remain, each of which the next chapter will exploit.

**Fact 1: Inference uses the same transformer forward pass as training.** Same architecture, same weights. Whatever you understand about "how a transformer block works" during training applies exactly to inference. No structural difference in the computation graph.

**Fact 2: Training processes many tokens per forward pass; inference decode processes one.** This is the reason inference is memory-bound while training is compute-bound, and it is the reason every inference technique in this book can be read as "how do we get more useful work out of each forward pass?"

**Fact 3: Inference has no gradients, no loss, no updates.** The weights are frozen. This may seem like a simplification, but it is actually a constraint. At training time, we could adjust the model to make it faster; at inference time, we can only adjust *how we use* the model. Every technique in this book is a "how we use" technique, not a "how we change" technique. The exceptions, fine-tuning, distillation, LoRA adapters (Chapter 22), are not inference per se; they are training tricks that produce inference-time benefits.

---

### 4.8: Where the asymmetry goes

If the training forward pass and the inference forward pass are the same computation, why does inference need its own book? Why can't we just read a training paper and know everything?

Because **the cost structure changes completely when the input shape changes**. A training forward pass operates on a tensor of shape `(B, N, d)` with `B = 8+`, `N = 2048+`. An inference decode forward pass operates on a tensor of shape `(1, 1, d)`. Same weights, same operations, but one is a matrix-matrix multiplication (compute-dense, high AI) and the other is a matrix-vector multiplication (memory-bound, low AI).

The *math* is the same. The *physics* is different. A matrix-vector multiplication on an H100 uses less than 1% of the GPU's compute capacity. The GPU cannot help you run the weights through faster than the memory bus can deliver them. No algorithmic cleverness changes this.

What algorithmic cleverness *can* do is reduce the number of bytes that need to flow through the memory bus per generated token. That is what the KV cache does (Chapter 7), what MLA does (Chapter 8), what FlashAttention does (Chapter 10), what quantization does (Chapter 13), what continuous batching does (Chapter 14). Every one of those techniques is an attempt to reduce per-token memory traffic so that more compute can happen per byte moved.

The asymmetry between training and inference is the *reason* this book exists. Training happens once, at enormous cost, and you can live with that cost because it is capital. Inference happens forever, at per-user cost, and you cannot live with the naive cost structure because it compounds linearly with traffic. An inference engineer's job is to take the frozen weights of a trained model and make them serve tokens at one or two orders of magnitude lower per-token cost than the naive implementation would.

---

### 4.9: Where we go next

Chapter 5 takes the pre-training forward pass we have just described and shows what happens when you try to use it naively for inference. You will see, step by step, exactly what is redundant and what can be cached. The technique that falls out of this, the KV cache, is the foundation of every subsequent optimization in the book.

Then Chapter 6 introduces the GPU hardware we have been talking about without ever looking at. And from Chapter 7 onward, every runtime-layer technique is a response to a specific inefficiency of that cached inference loop.

# Breadcrumb: Foundations Laid

You are now through the first five chapters (0 through 4) of this book. Before we step into the runtime layer, where the real techniques live, let us pause and take stock of where you are on the map.

---

## The journey so far

You started in Chapter 0 with a single claim: **inference engineering is the most consequential discipline in applied AI in 2026**. You saw why from a single real Vizuara product: a live AI tutor whose $300,000-per-month Gemini bill made the economics case, self-hosting open-source models is not an optimization, it is survival. You saw that inference happens across a six-tier hardware spectrum, from Raspberry Pi (1-5 tok/s) to Taalas (~17,000 tok/s), and that Apple is building the largest on-device inference push in the industry.

Chapter 1 gave you the map. Three concentric rings, **runtime**, **infrastructure**, **tooling**, and the reason they must be learned in that order. The runtime layer is about one GPU going faster. The infrastructure layer is about many GPUs working together. The tooling layer is about shipping. The inference engineer lives at the intersection, and the most common failure mode in applied AI today is picking the tooling layer (vLLM, SGLang) without understanding the two rings beneath it.

Chapter 2 gave you the scoreboard. **Five numbers**, TTFT, ITL, TPS, P99, $/M tokens, that every inference decision in this book ultimately moves. You saw why each matters, how each is measured, and which stakeholder in a company will fight you on each. You also saw the fundamental trade-off between system throughput and per-user latency, which Figure 2.4 made visual. Remember the sweet spot around batch size 16-32 on H100; that number will come back.

Chapter 3 gave you the north star. The **GPU roofline** is the single diagram on which every technique in this book sits. You derived it from first principles, the two hardware ceilings (bandwidth and compute), the arithmetic intensity that decides which ceiling you hit first, the ridge point where both are saturated. You placed prefill and decode on it and saw that they live in opposite regimes: prefill is compute-bound, decode is memory-bound. And you saw how every runtime-layer technique moves the operating point in one of three directions, right (higher AI), up (higher ceiling), or up-right (climb the slope via batching). Every subsequent chapter will return to Figure 3.1.

Chapter 4 closed the foundation with a careful detour through pre-training. You saw that training and inference are the *same* forward pass with opposite input shapes and opposite cost structures. Training is compute-bound, uses massive batches, and runs for months. Inference is memory-bound, uses tiny batches, and must respond in milliseconds. You saw the 6× rule for training FLOPs and the 2× rule for inference FLOPs, and you saw why inference is the operational cost that dominates a model's lifetime, roughly 10× to 100× more than training.

---

## What you can do now

If you read carefully, you can now:

* Look at any new inference technique and ask, *which layer does this live on?* (Chapter 1's three rings.)
* Look at any claim of "speedup" and ask, *which of the five metrics does this move, and at what cost to the others?* (Chapter 2.)
* Look at any optimization and ask, *which direction does this move the roofline dot?* (Chapter 3.)
* Look at any transformer and know that the weights are frozen at inference, the forward pass is the same, and the cost structure changes because the batch dimension collapses from hundreds to one. (Chapter 4.)

These four lenses, layers, metrics, roofline, the training/inference asymmetry, are the mental machinery you need for the rest of the book. Every technique from Chapter 5 onward will be analyzed with all four.

---

## Where we go next

The remaining twenty-five chapters are where the techniques live. The path is roughly:

* **Chapter 5** walks through *naive inference*: what happens when you use the pre-training forward pass directly, one token at a time. You will see exactly what is redundant, which sets up the KV cache, the single biggest optimization in inference.
* **Chapter 6** is the one hardware chapter: a tour of the GPU, but only the parts an inference engineer actually interacts with. SRAM, HBM, tensor cores, warps, NVLink.
* **Chapters 7 through 15** are the runtime layer, nine chapters on the KV cache, attention variants, FlashAttention, PagedAttention, quantization, continuous batching, and speculative decoding. This is the heart of the book.
* **Chapters 16 through 18** are the infrastructure layer, parallelism, disaggregation, replication, routing.
* **Chapters 19 through 21** are the tooling layer, vLLM in depth, SGLang, TensorRT-LLM, and the engine landscape of 2026.
* **Chapter 22** covers fine-tuning and distillation as they touch inference economics, including the subliminal-learning experiment.
* **Chapter 23** tours the frontiers: multimodal (voice, audio, video) and embodied (world models, robotic pipelines).
* **Chapters 24 through 26** are capstone projects: a speed-optimized server, scaling to one million users on Modal, and OpenClaw-RL.

The pace changes starting in Chapter 5. So far you have been reading foundations. From here on, you are reading techniques, and most of them come with explicit matrix walkthroughs, concrete numbers, and a "place on the roofline" statement at the end of each chapter.

Take a breath. Refill your coffee. Chapter 5 is where the real work begins.

# Chapter 5: Naive Inference and Its Redundancy

In Chapter 4 we established that inference uses the same transformer forward pass as training, but with a collapsed batch dimension (one token per step instead of thousands) and no backward pass. That is a compact statement. This chapter unpacks it completely, because buried in that statement is the largest wasted computation in all of applied AI, and the single optimization that unlocks the rest of this book.

Here is the plan. We take the pre-training forward pass we saw in Chapter 4 and try to use it naively for inference. We walk through it token by token on a four-token toy example, with actual matrix values, and watch what happens. By the time the fifth token enters the computation, you will see with your own eyes that **four out of five rows of the attention matrices are being recomputed from identical inputs to identical outputs at every single step**. That is the redundancy of the chapter title. Fix it, cache the K and V matrices from prior tokens, and you have the KV cache, which reduces decode cost from O(N² · d) per token to O(N · d) per token. On a 4,096-token context, that is roughly a 1,000× reduction in per-step FLOPs.

This chapter is matrix-heavy by design. Read with a notebook or the figures in front of you. Every claim about redundancy is demonstrated on specific numbers, and the numbers will become the canonical toy values used throughout the rest of the book.

## The Autoregressive Loop, in One Picture

### 5.1: What naive inference looks like

Inference begins with a **prompt**, a sequence of input tokens the user has supplied. "The next day is" gets tokenized to something like `[0, 1, 2, 3]` under a given vocabulary. The model's job is to produce the next token, append it to the sequence, and repeat, until some stopping condition (special `<end>` token, max length, user cancellation) fires.

![Figure 5.1: The Autoregressive Decode Loop](figures/ch05-fig1-autoregressive-loop/final.png)
*Figure 5.1.* Four boxes in a horizontal flow. Box 1: "Input tokens so far." Box 2: "Transformer forward pass." Box 3: "Logits over vocabulary." Box 4: "Sample next token." A curved arrow loops from Box 4 back to Box 1, labeled "append and repeat."

Figure 5.1 is the simplest possible description of autoregressive generation. At each step of the loop:

1. Take the current sequence of tokens.
2. Run it through the full transformer forward pass (the same forward pass used in training, Chapter 4).
3. Extract the logits for the *last* position only (since that is where the next-token prediction lives).
4. Sample a token from those logits (using temperature, top-k, top-p, whichever strategy is configured).
5. Append the sampled token to the sequence.
6. Loop.

This is the correct algorithm. It produces the right output. A language model running this loop will generate coherent text indistinguishable from one running any optimized inference stack, the semantics are identical. The *cost* is not. Every time through the loop, we rerun the full transformer forward pass on the *entire* sequence so far. If we have generated 500 new tokens on top of a 100-token prompt, the 501st-token decode step runs a forward pass on 600 tokens. That is the problem.

---

### 5.2: Why the loop is expensive

The forward-pass cost of a transformer scales with the number of input tokens. For a sequence of length N and hidden dimension d, the dominant operations are:

* Q, K, V projections: `3 × 2 × N × d² = 6Nd²` FLOPs
* Attention scores (Q · Kᵀ): `2 × N² × d` FLOPs
* Context (weights · V): `2 × N² × d` FLOPs
* Output projection: `2 × N × d²` FLOPs
* FFN (two layers, 4d expansion): `16 × N × d²` FLOPs

Per transformer layer, the FLOP cost for one forward pass is roughly:

```
FLOPs_per_layer ≈ 24 N d² + 4 N² d
```

For `d = 4096` (Llama-3-8B) and `N = 600` (our 500-token decode hypothetical):

```
FLOPs_per_layer  ≈  24 × 600 × 4096²  +  4 × 600² × 4096
                  ≈  2.4 × 10¹⁰  +  5.9 × 10⁹
                  ≈  3.0 × 10¹⁰   (per layer per forward pass)
```

For a 32-layer model: `~10¹² FLOPs per forward pass`.

Now multiply by 500 decode steps (one per output token): **5 × 10¹⁴ FLOPs**, roughly 500 teraflops of compute, to generate one 500-token response.

Most of that is wasted. We are about to see exactly why.

---

## Where the Redundancy Hides

### 5.3: Tracing the same computation twice

Consider two successive decode steps on a toy system: N=4 tokens to N=5 tokens. The 4-token prompt is "The next day is." After the first forward pass, we sample the next token; suppose it is "bright." Now we want the forward pass on "The next day is bright."

![Figure 5.2: Naive Inference Recomputes Everything at Every Step](figures/ch05-fig2-naive-recomputes-everything/final.png)
*Figure 5.2.* Three stacked snapshots of the Q, K, V matrices at decode steps T=4, T=5, and T=6. At T=4, each matrix has 4 rows (one per token). At T=5, each matrix has 5 rows, with the first 4 highlighted as the SAME pale lavender and the new 5th row in a darker shade. At T=6, same pattern with 6 rows. Annotation below: "The first rows of Q, K, V are re-computed from scratch every single step. This is wasted work."

Look carefully at Figure 5.2. At step T=4, the model computed Q, K, V matrices with 4 rows each, one row per token. At step T=5, it has to produce Q, K, V matrices with 5 rows, one row per token again. The first 4 rows (The, next, day, is) are identical between steps T=4 and T=5, because they are computed from identical inputs (the same four token embeddings) multiplied by identical weight matrices (`W_Q`, `W_K`, `W_V`, frozen at training time). **Whatever Q, K, V were at T=4, they are exactly the same at T=5 for those four rows.** Only the fifth row (for "bright") is genuinely new.

Yet in the naive loop, the model recomputes all 5 rows at T=5. The 4 rows that didn't change get recomputed anyway. Then at T=6, it recomputes 6 rows, of which 5 haven't changed. And so on. The recomputation cost grows linearly with sequence length, when the *new information* per step is a constant one row.

This is the redundancy. It is trivial once stated, embarrassing once recognized, and expensive once measured.

---

### 5.4: The toy walkthrough: T=4 in detail

Let us make the redundancy concrete by walking through one specific forward pass, on specific numbers, step by step. This is the canonical toy example you will see throughout the book.

**Setup.**
- N = 4 tokens: "The", "next", "day", "is"
- d = 4 (model dimension, small for visibility)
- H = 1 head, D = 4 (head dimension)
- Two layers total; we trace one layer

**Q and K matrices.** Given these inputs and the frozen weight matrices `W_Q` and `W_K`, the model produces Q and K of shape (4, 4). For the canonical toy used throughout this book, their values are:

![Figure 5.3: Computing Q and K at T=4](figures/test-matmul-fig1-inputs/final.png)
*Figure 5.3.* Two matrices side by side, each 4 rows by 4 columns, row labels "The" / "next" / "day" / "is", column labels c0 / c1 / c2 / c3. Q on the left in pale lavender, K on the right in pale mint.

Figure 5.3 shows Q and K for the 4-token input. Each row of Q represents one token's "query" vector, what that token is looking for in the context. Each row of K represents one token's "key", what it offers to be matched against. The numerical values are what the trained weights produce from the input embeddings of "The", "next", "day", "is."

**Attention scores.** The next step computes `scores = Q · Kᵀ / √d`, which for N=4, d=4 is a 4×4 matrix. To compute this we first take the transpose of K:

![Figure 5.4: Transposing K](figures/test-matmul-fig2-transpose/final.png)
*Figure 5.4.* K on the left (row labels "The"/"next"/"day"/"is", column labels c0/c1/c2/c3). A faint "transpose" arrow in the middle. K^T on the right (row labels c0/c1/c2/c3, column labels "The"/"next"/"day"/"is"). Same numbers, rows become columns.

Now we multiply Q (on the left) by K^T (on the right). The (i, j) entry of the result is the dot product of row i of Q with column j of K^T, which is the dot product of row i of Q with row j of K. For example, score[0][0] = "The" attending to "The":

![Figure 5.5: Computing One Cell: score[0][0]](figures/test-matmul-fig3-single-cell/final.png)
*Figure 5.5.* Three matrices in a row. Q on the left with row 0 ("The") highlighted. K^T in the middle with column 0 ("The") highlighted. Scores on the right with only cell [0][0] filled in at 0.150. Below, the equation: `score[0][0] = Q[0] · K[0]ᵀ / √4 = (0.02 + 0.06 + 0.20 + 0.02) / 2 = 0.300 / 2 = 0.150`.

```
score[0][0] = Q[0] · K[0]ᵀ / √4 = 0.150
```

Sweeping Q row 0 across all four columns of Kᵀ fills in the first row of the scores matrix:

![Figure 5.6: Filling Row 0 of Scores](figures/test-matmul-fig4-first-row/final.png)
*Figure 5.6.* Q on the left with row 0 highlighted. Scores on the right with row 0 fully populated: [0.150, 0.135, 0.135, 0.110]. Rows 1, 2, 3 of Scores are empty. Annotation: "Q row 0 sweeps all 4 columns of K^T, filling Scores row 0."

Repeating this for the other three rows of Q fills in the full scores matrix:

![Figure 5.7: Full Scores Matrix at T=4](figures/test-matmul-fig5-full-scores/final.png)
*Figure 5.7.* The complete 4×4 Scores matrix. Row labels and column labels are "The" / "next" / "day" / "is". All 16 cells populated.

```
Scores (4 × 4):
         "The"  "next"  "day"   "is"
"The"    0.150  0.135   0.135   0.110
"next"   0.110  0.115   0.185   0.120
"day"    0.190  0.225   0.295   0.180
"is"     0.100  0.145   0.180   0.095
```

After the causal mask (zeroing out the upper triangle so tokens can't attend to the future) and softmax, these scores become attention weights. Multiplying the weights by V produces the context vector for each of the 4 tokens. All 4 rows of the context matrix are computed, and the final one goes through the output projection, the FFN, and the unembedding to produce the logits from which we sample "bright."

So far, so expected. This is the standard transformer forward pass Chapter 4 described. Now let's see what happens at T=5.

---

### 5.5: The toy walkthrough: T=5, where the redundancy appears

At T=5, the input sequence is now "The next day is bright." The same weight matrices `W_Q`, `W_K`, `W_V` are applied to a 5-token input embedding.

The result is a Q matrix with 5 rows, a K matrix with 5 rows, a V matrix with 5 rows. Each matrix has one more row than at T=4.

**Crucial question: do the first 4 rows of each matrix change between T=4 and T=5?**

No. Absolutely not. They cannot. The first 4 rows of Q are computed from the first 4 rows of X (the input embeddings of "The", "next", "day", "is") multiplied by W\_Q. The input embeddings are unchanged (they came from the same tokens). W\_Q is unchanged (it is frozen). Therefore the first 4 rows of Q are identical to what they were at T=4. Same argument for K and V.

Only the 5th row is new, computed from the new embedding of "bright" multiplied by the frozen weight matrices.

![Figure 5.8: The Redundancy Visualized: T=4 vs T=5](figures/ch05-fig5-redundancy-visualized/final.png)
*Figure 5.8.* Two panels side by side. Left: K at T=4, 4 rows in pale lavender. Right: K at T=5, 5 rows, the first 4 IDENTICAL to the left panel, the 5th row in a darker shade. A big bracket labeled "IDENTICAL, 80% of this computation is wasted." Below, a mirrored panel for V matrices.

Figure 5.8 makes the waste visual. Four out of five rows of K at T=5 are exactly equal to the four rows of K at T=4. If we had **saved** those four rows from the T=4 computation, we would not need to recompute them at T=5. Same for V.

Q is the interesting case. The first 4 rows of Q at T=5 are also identical to the first 4 rows at T=4, but **we do not need those rows any more**. Q[0] through Q[3] were used at T=4 to compute the context vectors for tokens 0 through 3, and those context vectors produced predictions for tokens 1 through 4 (recall the shift-by-one from Chapter 4). At T=5, we only want to produce the next token *after* position 4. That prediction comes from the context vector of position 4, which requires only Q[4], the query for the new token "bright."

In other words: at decode step T=5, we need exactly one new Q vector (for position 4, the "current" token), and we need the full K and V matrices (all 5 rows) so that Q[4] can attend to every previous token. The previous rows of Q are never consulted again.

**This is the insight.** Cache K and V. Do not cache Q.

---

### 5.6: What we actually need, working backwards

Let us formalize this by working backwards from the output we need.

![Figure 5.9: Working Backwards: What Do We Actually Need for the Next Token?](figures/ch05-fig6-what-we-actually-need/final.png)
*Figure 5.9.* Three vertical boxes top-to-bottom. Top: "Goal: Predict the token after 'bright' (position 4)." Middle: "We need ONE logit vector, for position 4." Bottom: "That logit vector comes from ONE context vector, the last row of the context matrix." A big annotation arrow: "We do NOT need the first 4 rows of context; they predicted earlier tokens and are now useless."

The logits for the next token come from the context vector of the current position. The context vector of position 4 comes from the attention weights of position 4 (a single row, length 5) multiplied by the full V matrix (5 rows by d columns). The attention weights of position 4 come from Q[4] (one row) multiplied by all 5 rows of K^T, then softmax-normalized.

So at decode step T=5 we need:

1. **Q[4]**, the new query vector. Must be computed fresh by multiplying the new token's embedding (one row) by W\_Q.
2. **All 5 rows of K.** Must be present somewhere.
3. **All 5 rows of V.** Must be present somewhere.

We need nothing else from Q. Q[0] through Q[3] are irrelevant at this step.

If we cached K and V from T=4, then at T=5 we only need to compute the **single new row** of each (for "bright") and append it to the cache. We do not recompute rows 0-3. We do not recompute anything else that depended only on X[0..3] either, in particular, we do not recompute the context vectors for positions 0-3, since they were used already at T=4 to predict their own next tokens.

![Figure 5.10: Attention Weights × V = Context Vector for the New Token](figures/ch05-fig7-attention-weights-times-V/final.png)
*Figure 5.10.* Left-to-right equation: attention weights for the last token (1 row × 5 columns) × full V matrix (5 rows × 4 columns) = context vector for "bright" (1 row × 4 columns). Annotation on V: "We DO need the full V matrix, that is why V is cached." Annotation on weights: "We only need ONE row of attention weights, that is why we do not cache attention scores."

Figure 5.10 shows the final multiplication. Note that the full V matrix is used, all 5 rows, because the single new query must attend to all past tokens. This is why V must be cached (all rows preserved across steps), while attention scores can be computed fresh per step for just the one new row.

This is the policy in one sentence:

> **At every decode step, compute Q, K, and V for the new token. Append the new K and V to a persistent cache. Recompute attention weights only for the new row. Recompute the context vector only for the new row. Do everything else on the full caches.**

---

### 5.7: Which quantities get cached, which get recomputed

![Figure 5.11: Fresh vs Reuse at Every Decode Step](figures/ch05-fig8-decision-tree-fresh-vs-reuse/final.png)
*Figure 5.11.* A decision tree. Root: "For each quantity at decode step T+1, do we compute fresh or reuse from cache?" Five branches: (1) New token's Q vector, COMPUTE FRESH, (2) New token's K vector, COMPUTE FRESH (then append to cache), (3) New token's V vector, COMPUTE FRESH (then append to cache), (4) Old tokens' K vectors, REUSE FROM CACHE, (5) Old tokens' V vectors, REUSE FROM CACHE. Below: "Per step: 3 fresh vectors computed, 2(N-1) vectors read from cache. Speedup grows with N."

Figure 5.11 is the scheduling summary. Per decode step:

* **Compute fresh (3 things):** Q for the new token, K for the new token, V for the new token. Each is one row × d dimensions. Cost: three matrix-vector multiplications of a 1×d input by a d×d weight, totaling 6d² FLOPs.
* **Reuse from cache (2×(N-1) vectors):** K rows 0 through N-2, V rows 0 through N-2. These are read from HBM; no computation.
* **Compute incidentally:** attention weights for the single new query row (1×N), context vector for the new position (1×d), output projection (1×d²), FFN (1×d² × 4 and back), logits (1×d × V).

Total per-step FLOP cost in the cached regime:

```
FLOPs_per_step_cached  ≈  6d² (Q,K,V projections)  +  2Nd (attention scores for 1 query over N keys)
                            +  2Nd (weights × V for 1 context row)
                            +  24d² (output + FFN projections)
                         ≈  30d²  +  4Nd         (approx, per layer)
```

Compare this to the naive cost from §5.2: `24Nd² + 4N²d` per layer. The difference, dominated by the `d²` term, is exactly the factor of N:

```
FLOPs_naive / FLOPs_cached  ≈  24Nd² / 30d²  ≈  0.8 × N
```

For N = 4096, that is a **3,200× FLOP reduction per decode step**, almost exactly matching the 1,000× estimate in this chapter's opening paragraph once you account for the bandwidth-bound regime.

---

### 5.8: Why cache K and V, but not Q?

We said it above, but it is worth stating in its own section because it is the kind of thing that sticks once you see it clearly.

![Figure 5.12: Why Cache K and V but Never Q?](figures/ch05-fig9-why-not-cache-Q/final.png)
*Figure 5.12.* A 2×2 grid. Top-left: "What role does Q play?", "Q represents what the CURRENT token is looking for in the past." Top-right: "When is Q\_i used?", "Only at step i, when token i is being decoded. After that step, Q\_i is never consulted again." Bottom-left: "What role do K and V play?", "K and V represent how past tokens describe themselves to FUTURE queries." Bottom-right: "When are K\_i, V\_i used?", "K\_i and V\_i are consulted at every step i, i+1, i+2, ... forever." Below the grid: "Q is single-use. K and V are reused forever. That is why only K and V get cached."

The asymmetry in Figure 5.12 is what justifies the asymmetric caching policy. In the attention mechanism, Q comes from "the current position asking a question," while K and V come from "every past position answering questions." The attention equation is:

```
attention_i  =  softmax(Q[i] · Kᵀ / √d) · V
```

For token at position i, we need Q[i] (one row), and we need K and V for all positions 0 through i (because position i attends to all previous positions, including itself).

Next token, at position i+1, we need Q[i+1] (one row, fresh). Q[i] is never consulted again. We still need K and V for all positions 0 through i+1, including the previous ones. So K[0..i] and V[0..i] are reused; Q[i] is not.

This is not a clever insight; it is a trivial consequence of the attention formula. And yet it is *the* insight that generates almost the entire runtime layer of this book. The KV cache is the foundation, and every technique in Chapters 7-15 is a response to some limitation of the KV cache, either compressing it, sharing it, rearranging how it is accessed, or scheduling around its growth.

---

### 5.9: The FLOP reduction, quantified

Figure 5.13 plots the FLOP curve for naive vs cached decode as a function of sequence length.

![Figure 5.13: FLOP Cost per Decode Step: Naive vs With KV Cache](figures/ch05-fig10-flop-reduction-curve/final.png)
*Figure 5.13.* A line chart. X-axis: sequence length N, from 0 to 4096. Y-axis: FLOPs per decode step, log scale from 10⁶ to 10¹². Two curves, naive (O(N²·d), rising quadratically) and cached (O(N·d), rising linearly). A vertical bracket at N=4096 labeled "~1000× speedup."

The gap in Figure 5.13 is the gap the KV cache closes. At short sequences (N < 100), the two curves are close, the quadratic term hasn't dominated yet. At N = 500, the gap is ~100×. At N = 4096, the gap is ~1000×. At long context (N = 32K, which modern models routinely hit), the gap is ~10,000×.

Without the KV cache, no LLM with a context window over a few hundred tokens is feasible at interactive latency. With the KV cache, 32K tokens is comfortable and 128K tokens is routine. Every long-context capability in a modern chat product traces back to this one cache.

---

## The Speedup and Its Consequences

### 5.10: The new decode loop

Here is the revised algorithm, now that we cache K and V. This is *the* inference decode loop that every modern serving engine implements.

```
Algorithm: KV-cached autoregressive decode

Initialize:
    - Compute and store K_cache = K[prompt], V_cache = V[prompt]
      by running one parallel forward pass on the prompt (PREFILL)
    - Set N := length of prompt

Loop:
    1. Take the most recently generated token's embedding x_new (shape 1 × d)
    2. Compute q_new = x_new · W_Q                (shape 1 × d)
    3. Compute k_new = x_new · W_K                (shape 1 × d)
    4. Compute v_new = x_new · W_V                (shape 1 × d)
    5. Append k_new to K_cache, v_new to V_cache  (cache grows to N+1 rows)
    6. Compute attention scores for the new query:
           scores_new = q_new · K_cacheᵀ / √d      (shape 1 × (N+1))
    7. Apply softmax to scores_new, get attention weights (shape 1 × (N+1))
    8. Compute context vector:
           context_new = weights_new · V_cache     (shape 1 × d)
    9. Run output projection and FFN on context_new
   10. Project context to logits
   11. Sample next token, append to output sequence
   12. N := N + 1
   13. If end-of-sequence token or max length, exit; else go to 1
```

The prefill step at initialization runs once and is compute-bound (a normal batched forward pass on N prompt tokens). Every subsequent decode step is cheap, per-step cost is O(N·d) for the attention part and O(d²) for the projection/FFN parts, compared to O(N²·d) and O(N·d²) respectively in naive inference.

This is exactly the algorithm that separates prefill from decode in the Chapter 3 roofline. **Prefill is the compute-heavy initialization; decode is the memory-bound loop.** The KV cache is what makes decode memory-bound in the first place. Without caching, decode would be as compute-heavy as prefill. With caching, it loses the quadratic compute term and is dominated by the memory bandwidth needed to read K\_cache and V\_cache each step.

---

### 5.11: Where this places you on the roofline

Back to Chapter 3's north star. The KV cache moves the decode operating point to the left on the roofline.

Here is why. Before the KV cache, naive decode did O(N²·d) FLOPs per step and read O(N·d) bytes of K and V (since it had to read all past tokens for attention anyway). Arithmetic intensity ≈ N FLOPs per byte, roughly the same as prefill, actually compute-bound for long N.

After the KV cache, cached decode does O(N·d) FLOPs per step (mostly the attention kernel, since projections are now 1×d rather than N×d) and reads O(N·d) bytes of K and V cache plus O(d²) bytes of weights. Arithmetic intensity drops to roughly 1 FLOP per byte, deep in the memory-bound region.

The KV cache **solves the FLOPs problem and creates the bandwidth problem**. It trades a 1000× FLOP reduction for a bandwidth constraint that becomes the dominant bottleneck in the entire rest of the book.

This is the "dark side of the KV cache" we will spend Chapter 7 onward addressing. The KV cache makes inference tractable. It also puts decode in a regime where every remaining optimization is about reducing the bytes that move through HBM, because the FLOPs were already the easy part.

---

### 5.12: Prefill vs decode, finally distinct

We have been using the words "prefill" and "decode" since Chapter 0. Now they have precise definitions.

**Prefill** is the initialization phase of the KV-cached algorithm. Given a prompt of N tokens, run one parallel forward pass over all N tokens, producing the full K cache (N×H×D), the full V cache (N×H×D), and the logits for the final position (from which the first output token is sampled). Prefill is compute-bound because the forward pass has N tokens × d dimensions × d² weights of arithmetic and only N×d bytes of activations to move. Arithmetic intensity is ~d/2, far above the roofline ridge.

**Decode** is the main loop after prefill. Each step processes exactly one new token: compute new Q, K, V rows (one each), append to caches, compute attention for the new query over the full K/V caches, generate the logits, sample the next token. Decode is memory-bound because the forward pass moves full weight matrices from HBM for only 1 token of arithmetic. Arithmetic intensity is ~1, deep below the ridge.

This is why prefill and decode are treated differently throughout the rest of the book. They are not two phases of the same operation, they are two fundamentally different computations with different bottlenecks. Many advanced techniques exploit that distinction:

* **Disaggregated prefill/decode** (Chapter 17) puts them on different GPUs.
* **Chunked prefill** (Chapter 12) interleaves prefill chunks with ongoing decodes.
* **Continuous batching** (Chapter 14) packs multiple decodes into one forward pass.

All three rely on the prefill/decode distinction that only becomes meaningful once you have the KV cache, which is why Chapter 5 is where we name it.

---

### 5.13: What we pay for

The KV cache is the single biggest speedup in inference engineering. It is also the source of the single biggest cost we still have to manage.

Recall the formula for KV cache size:

```
KV bytes  =  2 (K and V)  ×  N  ×  H  ×  D  ×  L  ×  2 bytes per element (FP16)
           =  4 × N × H × D × L
```

For Llama-3-70B at `N = 32,768`:

```
KV bytes  =  4 × 32,768 × 8 × 128 × 80  =  2.68 × 10¹⁰  =  ~25 GB per user
```

Twenty-five gigabytes per user session. On an H100 with 80 GB HBM, of which 40 GB is model weights and 5 GB is activation workspace, there is room for roughly 1.4 concurrent users before memory runs out. That is unworkable. If each user needs 25 GB, we cannot serve many users simultaneously.

This is the problem that generates the next ten chapters:

* **Chapter 7** names the trade-off in full.
* **Chapter 8** compresses the cache across attention heads (MHA → MQA → GQA → MLA).
* **Chapter 9** compresses across tokens (sliding window, linear attention, state-space models, Mamba).
* **Chapter 10** tiles attention into SRAM to reduce per-step reads (FlashAttention).
* **Chapter 11** paginates the cache to eliminate fragmentation (PagedAttention).
* **Chapter 12** shares prefixes across users and chunks prefill (prefix caching + chunked prefill).
* **Chapter 13** quantizes the cache itself to half the bytes (FP8/INT4 KV cache).

Every one of those chapters can be read as a direct descendant of the redundancy argument in this chapter. The KV cache is the foundation; everything after is a response to its costs.

---

### 5.14: Where we go next

We have derived the KV cache from first principles, shown the matrix-level redundancy it eliminates, and placed both the cached and uncached decode operating points on the roofline.

Before we go deeper into cache compression techniques, we need one more foundation. We have been talking about the GPU as a black box, "reads from HBM", "compute ceiling", "arithmetic intensity", without looking at the hardware itself. Chapter 6 is the one hardware chapter in this book: the GPU, through the lens of inference. Streaming multiprocessors, tensor cores, warp schedulers, the memory hierarchy, NVLink and InfiniBand. Every hardware concept in that chapter is one we have been implicitly assuming. After Chapter 6 we will have all the tools to tackle the runtime layer head-on.

# Chapter 6: The Machine, A GPU, Through the Lens of Inference

Chapter 5 ended with a claim: the KV cache moves decode to the memory-bound region of the roofline. Chapter 3 introduced the roofline itself, bandwidth slope, compute ceiling, ridge point. Both chapters invoked a "GPU" as an abstract box with two numbers (bandwidth and peak FLOPs). In practice, a GPU is not a box. It is a layered machine, and every layer of the machine touches at least one decision an inference engineer makes.

This chapter is a brief and focused tour of that machine. It is deliberately not a complete GPU architecture reference, whole textbooks exist for that. It covers exactly the parts that map to inference-engineering decisions: why inference runs on a GPU at all, what the memory hierarchy looks like, what is inside a streaming multiprocessor, how tensor cores differ from CUDA cores, what warps and blocks are, and how GPUs are connected to each other. Everything we introduce here will reappear in a later chapter as the hardware constraint behind a technique.

If you already know this material, skim it. If you do not, read it carefully, every subsequent chapter will assume you can picture HBM, SRAM, tensor cores, and the NVLink topology in your head.

---

## Why We Need One Hardware Chapter

### 6.1: What changes when you see the machine

In Chapter 3 we computed arithmetic intensity symbolically: FLOPs divided by bytes. That was enough to reason about whether a kernel is memory-bound or compute-bound. It was not enough to reason about *why*. Why is HBM bandwidth 3.35 TB/sec and not 33 TB/sec? Why does FlashAttention fit its working set in SRAM and not in HBM? Why does tensor parallelism communicate via NVLink inside a node but InfiniBand across nodes? Why is FP8 compute twice as fast as FP16 compute on Hopper?

Each of those questions has a specific hardware answer. You do not need to memorize the answers, they change with each GPU generation. You do need to *know the shapes of the answers*, so that when a new GPU comes out (H200, B200, B300, MI355) you can read the spec sheet and predict which of your inference techniques will improve and by how much. That is what this chapter is for.

Here is the one-paragraph summary you will carry with you. **A modern GPU is a collection of ~100 compute engines (streaming multiprocessors), each containing thousands of small arithmetic units and a small bank of fast scratchpad memory. They all share one large pool of slow memory (HBM) and communicate with each other through a high-bandwidth fabric (NVLink). When you run inference, you are really asking: how do I keep those thousands of arithmetic units busy, given that most of them will spend most of their time waiting for data to arrive from HBM?** Every hardware detail in this chapter is a refinement of that single picture.

---

## The Machine, From the Outside In

### 6.2: Why inference runs on a GPU, not a CPU

Before we open the box, let us address the first design question: why a GPU at all? The short answer is: because transformer inference is almost entirely matrix multiplication, and a GPU spends its transistor budget on matrix-multiplication hardware, while a CPU spends its transistor budget on everything else.

![Figure 6.1: CPU vs GPU Transistor Budget](figures/ch06-fig1-cpu-vs-gpu-transistor-budget/final.png)
*Figure 6.1.* Two chip dies side by side. The CPU die shows four large cores surrounded by an enormous L3 cache, with dedicated branch prediction and out-of-order execution logic. The GPU die shows roughly 40 small tiles, streaming multiprocessors, densely packed, each tile containing its own compute units and registers, with only a thin L2 cache.

Figure 6.1 is the essence. A CPU is optimized to run one thread as fast as possible. It uses most of its silicon on complex control logic, branch prediction, speculative execution, out-of-order scheduling, and on large caches to hide main memory latency. This is the right design for workloads with unpredictable branching, pointer-chasing, or complex data dependencies. Compilers, databases, operating systems, web servers all rely on it.

A GPU is optimized to run thousands of threads in parallel on simple, uniform work. It spends almost no silicon on control or caches, and almost all of it on compute units, arithmetic logic units (ALUs), tensor cores, and the registers that feed them. This is the right design for workloads with lots of uniform parallel work and regular memory access patterns. Transformer inference is exactly such a workload: every layer is a matrix multiplication, and every matrix multiplication is thousands of independent dot products that can run simultaneously.

Put numbers on this. A modern Intel Xeon has about 32-64 cores and perhaps 128-256 total arithmetic units (after vector width). An H100 has 132 streaming multiprocessors, each with 128 FP32 CUDA cores plus four tensor cores, roughly 18,432 arithmetic lanes, plus specialized MAC hardware. The CPU can start a small number of threads quickly; the GPU can start a hundred thousand threads and keep most of them active.

![Figure 6.2: CPU vs GPU on a matmul](figures/ch06-fig2-cpu-vs-gpu-matmul/final.png)
*Figure 6.2.* A bar chart. Matrix multiplication throughput on a 4096×4096 FP16 matrix. CPU (Intel Xeon, 32 cores): ~1 TFLOPS. GPU (H100 Tensor Core FP16): ~989 TFLOPS. The bracket above the GPU bar reads "~1000× speedup on matmul."

For a specific workload, Figure 6.2 quantifies the asymmetry. A modern 32-core Xeon running a well-tuned FP16 matmul on a 4096×4096 matrix reaches roughly 1 TFLOPS. An H100 running the same matmul on its tensor cores reaches 989 TFLOPS. Same operation. Three orders of magnitude. This is why a CPU-hosted LLM that fits in RAM (via `llama.cpp`, for instance) runs at perhaps 5 tokens per second for a 7B model, while a GPU-hosted version can run at 200-500 tokens per second per user on a data-center GPU.

This is also the limit of the CPU option. You can run an LLM on a CPU, and for low-volume or privacy-sensitive workloads that is a legitimate choice (see Chapter 20's coverage of `llama.cpp` and Ollama). You cannot *scale* it. A CPU cannot make a matmul faster by deploying the matmul across many cores the same way a GPU can, there are not enough parallel lanes. For any production inference workload above a trivial scale, the GPU is the right answer, and every technique in this book assumes it.

### 6.3: The memory hierarchy that sets the roofline ceiling

A GPU has not one memory but several, each trading capacity for speed. Understanding this hierarchy is the prerequisite to understanding FlashAttention, PagedAttention, and every other technique that manipulates where data lives.

![Figure 6.3: GPU memory hierarchy](figures/ch06-memory-hierarchy/final.png)
*Figure 6.3.* A vertical stack of four storage tiers from bottom (large and slow) to top (small and fast). HBM / VRAM: 80 GB capacity, 3.35 TB/s bandwidth, ~600 cycle latency. L2 cache: 50 MB, 5 TB/s. SRAM / shared memory per SM: 228 KB, ~20 TB/s. Register file per SM: 256 KB, fastest access. Arrows on the right: "bandwidth increases, capacity decreases." Callouts on the left tie each tier to an inference concept (KV cache in HBM, FlashAttention tiles into SRAM, quantization reduces HBM traffic).

Figure 6.3 is the hierarchy. Four tiers, stacked in order of decreasing capacity and increasing speed.

**HBM (High Bandwidth Memory, sometimes called VRAM).** The big pool at the bottom. On an H100 it is 80 GB; on an H200 it is 141 GB; on a B200 it is 192 GB. The bandwidth is impressive by any historical standard, 3.35 TB/sec on H100, but relative to compute it is painfully slow. Recall from Chapter 3 that the ridge point on H100 FP16 is 295 FLOPs per byte, which means any kernel below that arithmetic intensity is HBM-bound. The model weights live here. The KV cache lives here. Most activation tensors live here. Every time you hear "memory-bound," you mean this tier.

**L2 cache.** Shared by the whole GPU, 50 MB on H100, 60 MB on H200. It sits between HBM and the SMs, automatically caching recently-read data. For kernels with good locality, an L2 hit is roughly 10× faster than an HBM access. FlashAttention benefits from L2 residence when the K and V block being processed is also the block being processed by neighboring warps.

**SRAM / shared memory (per SM).** The fast scratchpad inside each streaming multiprocessor. 228 KB on H100. This is the memory that FlashAttention tiles into, a 64×64 block of FP16 numbers is 8 KB, well within the budget, and operations on it execute in a few nanoseconds rather than the hundreds of nanoseconds it takes to fetch from HBM. SRAM is small enough that a single SM's kernel must fit its working set here if it wants to stay fast.

**Register file (per SM).** The fastest tier. 256 KB per SM, but carved up into per-thread private slices. A single thread typically has access to a few dozen 32-bit registers. The fused multiply-add instruction that dominates compute reads operands from registers, multiplies and adds them, and writes back to registers, the whole instruction executes in one cycle. Registers are where computation actually happens.

Pay close attention to the numerical ratios. Bandwidth increases by roughly an order of magnitude at each step up the hierarchy: HBM at 3.35 TB/s, L2 at ~5 TB/s, SRAM at ~20 TB/s, registers at effectively infinite bandwidth within-thread. Capacity decreases the same way: 80 GB, 50 MB, 228 KB per SM, ~256 KB per SM (but per-thread). **This inverse relationship is not negotiable.** You cannot have fast and large at the same time; that is a law of physics imposed by signal propagation, power, and die area.

![Figure 6.4: Bandwidth vs Capacity, log-log](figures/ch06-fig3-bandwidth-vs-capacity/final.png)
*Figure 6.4.* Log-log scatter plot. X-axis: capacity (bytes). Y-axis: bandwidth (TB/sec). Four points, registers, SRAM, L2, HBM, lie approximately along a descending diagonal. A dashed trend line labeled "inverse relationship: the bigger it is, the slower it is."

Figure 6.4 makes the ratio visible. The four storage tiers lie on a clear descending diagonal. If you want to move a kernel from memory-bound to compute-bound on the roofline, you do it by moving its working set *up* this hierarchy, out of HBM, into SRAM or registers. That is exactly what FlashAttention does. That is exactly what the entire Chapter 10 is about. And when someone says "this kernel is L2-resident" or "this kernel fits in SRAM," they mean: the working set fits within the capacity of that tier, and the bandwidth the kernel experiences is the bandwidth of that tier, not HBM.

This is also why **context length is a hardware problem, not just an algorithm problem**. A 100K-token KV cache for a 70B model is tens of gigabytes. It does not fit in SRAM; it does not fit in L2; it barely fits in HBM; it has to stream through HBM on every decode step. That streaming dominates ITL. Every long-context optimization in this book, MLA, sliding window, linear attention, quantized KV cache, is an attempt to reduce the bytes that stream through HBM per decode step.

### 6.4: Inside a streaming multiprocessor

The streaming multiprocessor (SM) is the GPU's unit of execution. When you launch a CUDA kernel, the runtime distributes its work across all available SMs. An H100 has 132 SMs. A B200 has 208. Understanding what is inside one SM is the key to understanding why warps, blocks, and tensor cores behave the way they do.

![Figure 6.5: Inside an H100 SM](figures/ch06-fig4-inside-an-sm/final.png)
*Figure 6.5.* A large rounded rectangle representing one H100 SM. Inside, four smaller rectangles labeled Processing Block 0 through 3, arranged 2×2. Each processing block contains a warp scheduler, dispatch unit, FP32 CUDA cores, FP16/BF16 tensor core, register file slice, and load/store unit. Underneath the four blocks, a single wide strip labeled "Shared L1 / SRAM (228 KB), shared by all 4 blocks."

Look at Figure 6.5. An SM is divided into four identical **processing blocks**. Each processing block has:

* **A warp scheduler.** Each cycle, the scheduler picks one of several resident warps (up to 16 warps per block, 64 per SM) and issues its next instruction. Warps that are stalled waiting for memory get skipped in favor of warps that have operands ready. This is how the GPU hides memory latency, it always has another warp ready to run.
* **A dispatch unit.** Takes the chosen warp's instruction and routes it to the appropriate execution pipeline: FP32 CUDA cores, tensor core, load/store unit, or special function unit (SFU) for transcendentals.
* **FP32 CUDA cores.** 32 per processing block, 128 per SM. These handle ordinary scalar floating-point operations, the vast majority of what a naive kernel runs on.
* **One tensor core.** Large, dense multiply-accumulate hardware that operates on 16×16 matrix tiles per instruction. A single tensor-core instruction performs thousands of multiply-adds. This is what makes the "989 TFLOPS FP16" number possible on H100, without tensor cores, the FP32 CUDA cores alone would deliver "only" 67 TFLOPS.
* **A register file slice.** 16,384 32-bit registers per processing block, 65,536 per SM. Registers are partitioned across the warps currently resident on the SM.
* **Load/store unit.** Issues memory operations, reads from HBM/L2/SRAM, writes to HBM.

Below the four processing blocks sits a shared unit: **228 KB of L1 / shared memory**, plus an L1 instruction cache. The shared memory is what FlashAttention tiles into. Every thread in every warp across every processing block can access it, giving a common scratchpad for cooperation.

Several facts about the SM matter for inference:

**Warp switches are free.** When a warp stalls (waiting for an HBM read, typically), the scheduler can switch to another warp in *one cycle*. There is no OS-style context save/restore because each thread's state lives permanently in the register file, nothing needs to be saved. This is the latency-hiding mechanism the GPU uses to tolerate HBM's 600-cycle latency: keep many warps resident, and always have one ready to run.

**Tensor cores are scarce and large.** One tensor core per processing block, four per SM, 528 total on H100. Each one can do roughly 2.5 TFLOPS of FP16 work. Compare to 128 FP32 CUDA cores per SM doing roughly 10 TFLOPS total across all CUDA cores, tensor cores dominate. Using the tensor core efficiently is what separates a kernel at 10% of peak from a kernel at 80% of peak. FlashAttention, TensorRT-LLM, and hand-tuned CUTLASS kernels all do; naive PyTorch does not.

**SRAM is shared across all four processing blocks.** This is how a thread in block 0 can read data written by a thread in block 3. It is also how FlashAttention's tiling strategy cooperates across the 128 threads of a single thread block, they all land on the same SM and share the same SRAM region.

The takeaway for an inference engineer: when you read that "FlashAttention-3 pushes H100 to ~85% of peak FP16," the "85% of peak" means that 85% of the tensor cores' possible operations are actually happening on every cycle. The remaining 15% is lost to warp stalls, SRAM bank conflicts, and compute/memory imbalance. Chapter 10 will trace how FlashAttention achieves this; for now, understand that the number comes from how efficiently the kernel uses the four processing blocks pictured in Figure 6.5.

### 6.5: Tensor cores and the two separate ceilings

We touched on this in Chapter 3 but did not explain the hardware reason. Here it is.

![Figure 6.6: Tensor core vs CUDA core peak throughput](figures/ch06-fig5-tensor-vs-cuda-ceilings/final.png)
*Figure 6.6.* Four vertical bars in increasing height. FP32 CUDA core: 67 TFLOPS (baseline). FP16 Tensor core: 989 TFLOPS (14× baseline). FP8 Tensor core: 1,979 TFLOPS (29× baseline). INT4 Tensor core: 3,958 TFLOPS (59× baseline). Caption above: "4 separate ceilings depending on precision."

A tensor core is not a general-purpose compute unit. It is a very specialized piece of hardware that does one specific thing extremely fast: take two small matrix tiles (typically 16×16 for FP16) and a third accumulator tile, compute the matrix product and add to the accumulator, and write back. The whole thing takes one instruction.

Crucially, **the tensor core has different hardware paths for different precisions**, and the paths get faster as the precision drops. An FP16 tile occupies half the silicon area of an FP32 tile, so twice as many tile-slots fit in the same tensor core. FP8 fits four times as many. INT4 fits eight times as many. Each precision reduction doubles the tensor core's peak throughput, at the cost of numerical range or precision.

This is why Figure 6.6 shows four stepped ceilings rather than one. When a kernel uses FP16 tensor cores, the ceiling is 989 TFLOPS. When it uses FP8 tensor cores, the ceiling is 1,979 TFLOPS, the same physical chip, reorganized to pack twice as many operations. When it uses INT4, the ceiling is 3,958 TFLOPS.

This is also why **quantization is not just about saving bytes**. Chapter 13 will treat quantization in depth, but the key point is already here: quantizing a model from FP16 to FP8 halves the bytes per weight (better for memory-bound decode) *and* doubles the compute ceiling (better for compute-bound prefill). Quantization is the rare optimization that wins in both regimes of the roofline.

One caution: reaching the higher ceiling requires both (a) weights stored at the lower precision and (b) a kernel implementation that actually uses the tensor-core path for that precision. Simply running an FP16 model and telling PyTorch "use FP8" does not get you 1,979 TFLOPS, you need a kernel written for FP8 tensor cores, which is why libraries like TransformerEngine, cuBLAS-Lt, and TensorRT-LLM matter so much for realizing quantization gains.

### 6.6: HBM is the decode bottleneck, explicitly

We have said multiple times that decode is memory-bound. Now the hardware picture makes it literal.

![Figure 6.7: HBM Is the Decode Bottleneck](figures/ch06-fig6-hbm-decode-bottleneck/final.png)
*Figure 6.7.* A horizontal illustration. On the top, a very wide pipe labeled "Compute throughput, 989 TFLOPS (FP16 tensor cores)." On the bottom, a very narrow pipe labeled "HBM memory bandwidth, 3.35 TB/s." Small data blobs are shown squeezing through the narrow pipe into the wide one. A card on the right annotates: "Decode step: 2 bytes per parameter × 7B params = 14 GB loaded per token. At 3.35 TB/s, that's 4.2 ms of pure HBM traffic per token. Compute sits idle most of the time."

Here is the concrete arithmetic in Figure 6.7. A 7B-parameter model stored in FP16 is 14 GB of weights. To produce one decode token, the entire weight tensor has to be read from HBM once, there is no way around it; every weight is used in every forward pass. At 3.35 TB/sec of HBM bandwidth:

```
time = 14 GB / 3.35 TB/s = 4.18 ms
```

That 4.18 milliseconds is the **floor of per-user ITL on H100 for Llama-3-7B at batch size 1**. No algorithm can go faster, because there is no way to produce a token without reading the weights, and there is no way to read 14 GB faster than 4.18 ms on an H100. FP8 quantization halves that to 2.09 ms. INT4 quantizes it to 1.05 ms. MLA does not help because MLA targets KV cache, not weights. FlashAttention does not help because FlashAttention targets attention memory traffic, not weight-loading. Even in principle, this floor is the hardware's final word.

To go below it, you need to *amortize* the single weight-load across multiple tokens. That is what continuous batching does, serve 32 users in the same forward pass, and the 4.18 ms is spread across 32 tokens, giving an effective 0.13 ms per token. That is what speculative decoding does, verify K draft tokens per forward pass, and the 4.18 ms covers K accepted tokens. These are not separate tricks; they are the direct consequence of the pipe in Figure 6.7 and the realization that whatever passes through it should be used for as many tokens as possible.

The wider pipe, compute, sits idle for most of the 4.18 ms. Compute can do 989 TFLOPS but only needs to execute ~28 GFLOPS for one forward pass of a 7B model (2 × 7B = 14 GFLOPs per token, plus attention). That is 28 / 989,000 = 0.003% of compute capacity utilized in wall-clock time. The rest of the cycle is spent waiting for bytes.

This asymmetry is the single most important fact in inference engineering, and every picture in Chapter 3 (the roofline) and Figure 6.7 (the pipe metaphor) says the same thing from different angles.

### 6.7: Threads, warps, blocks, and the grid

We have been talking about SMs and tensor cores at the hardware level. At the software level, GPU programs organize their work into a hierarchy. You need to understand this hierarchy because the names leak into every profiler, every serving-engine config, and every kernel description.

![Figure 6.8: Thread → Warp → Block → Grid](figures/ch06-fig7-thread-warp-block-grid/final.png)
*Figure 6.8.* Four nested boxes. Innermost: a single dot labeled "1 thread." Around it, a box enclosing 32 dots labeled "1 warp = 32 threads (SIMT group)." Around that, a larger box labeled "1 block = up to 1024 threads, one SM." Outermost: a box enclosing many blocks labeled "1 grid = all blocks in a kernel launch, spans the whole GPU." On the right, a concrete mapping example shows: one FlashAttention block handles one Q tile; one grid = N/64 blocks total; one tensor core op = 1 warp × 16×16×16 MMA.

Figure 6.8 is the hierarchy in one picture. Going from innermost to outermost:

**Thread.** The smallest unit. One thread has its own program counter and its own registers, and executes one instruction stream. Think of it as one worker.

**Warp.** A group of 32 threads that execute in **lockstep**, the same instruction, at the same time, on different data. This is called SIMT (single instruction, multiple threads) and it is the GPU's core parallelism primitive. If the 32 threads want to do different things (a branch where some take one path and some take the other), the warp serializes, first all threads take path A (those that shouldn't are masked), then all take path B. This is "warp divergence" and it is a common source of performance loss. Well-written kernels avoid it.

**Block.** A group of up to 1,024 threads (divided into up to 32 warps) that execute on a single SM. Threads in the same block can share data via the SM's SRAM and synchronize via block barriers. When you write a CUDA kernel, you declare how many threads per block and how many blocks in total; the runtime assigns blocks to SMs.

**Grid.** The full set of blocks launched by one kernel invocation. A grid might have thousands of blocks; the runtime distributes them across the 132 SMs of the H100.

For inference engineers, the mapping to techniques is the important thing. FlashAttention launches one block per query tile; the block processes that Q tile against all K/V tiles sequentially using the block's shared SRAM. Tensor parallelism shards weights across GPUs so each GPU runs the same kernel on a different slice of the matrix. Paged attention uses a custom kernel whose block structure matches the page-table layout.

You will rarely write these kernels yourself. But when you read a serving-engine config flag like `max_num_blocks_per_seq` (vLLM's PagedAttention), you will know it means "how many 16-token KV pages a single sequence can occupy," which relates back to the block-level memory management of the attention kernel. When a profiler says "warp occupancy 68%," it means the SMs had ~68% of their theoretical maximum warps resident and ready to run on average, a useful number to know whether a kernel is under-subscribed.

### 6.8: Inter-GPU bandwidth: NVLink and InfiniBand

Everything above has been about one GPU. Production inference often uses many. The bandwidth between them determines which parallelism strategies work.

![Figure 6.9: NVLink vs InfiniBand bandwidth](figures/ch06-fig8-nvlink-vs-infiniband/final.png)
*Figure 6.9.* A horizontal bar chart. Top bar (long, deep lavender): "NVLink (intra-node), 900 GB/s." Bottom bar (much shorter, pale pink): "InfiniBand (inter-node), 50 GB/s." The NVLink bar is roughly 18× longer than the InfiniBand bar. Annotation below: "Tensor parallelism MUST stay intra-node. Pipeline parallelism CAN cross nodes."

The two numbers in Figure 6.9 govern every multi-GPU deployment.

**NVLink** is NVIDIA's point-to-point GPU-to-GPU fabric inside a server node. On H100 systems, NVLink provides up to 900 GB/sec between any two GPUs in the same node (8 GPUs per node typically). This is extremely fast, close to HBM bandwidth itself.

**InfiniBand** (typically HDR or NDR, modern clusters use NDR at 400 Gb/sec per port, with multiple ports per node) is the fabric between server nodes in a cluster. Effective cross-node bandwidth is roughly 50 GB/sec after overhead.

The ratio is approximately 18:1. This is not a small difference. Any parallelism strategy whose communication frequency is high will choke on InfiniBand but run cleanly over NVLink. Specifically:

**Tensor parallelism** (TP), splits each matmul across GPUs and needs an AllReduce after every transformer block. A 70B model has 80 transformer blocks; TP means 80 AllReduces per forward pass, each moving a few tens of MBs. At 900 GB/sec over NVLink, one AllReduce takes tens of microseconds; trivial. At 50 GB/sec over InfiniBand, the same AllReduce takes hundreds of microseconds, multiplied by 80 layers, this becomes milliseconds per step, which destroys ITL. **TP must stay inside one node.**

**Pipeline parallelism** (PP), splits the model across layer groups so GPU 0 has layers 1-20, GPU 1 has 21-40, etc. Communication happens only when activations cross from one stage to the next, once per forward pass, with a payload of a few MB. Even over InfiniBand, this is fast enough. **PP can cross nodes.**

**Expert parallelism** (EP), routes MoE tokens to the GPUs holding their selected experts. This is hybrid: the top-K expert selection happens per-token (high-frequency), but only the tokens whose experts live on remote GPUs incur cross-node communication. Efficient EP designs keep most experts co-located with their assigned GPUs.

Chapter 16 will work through these parallelism strategies in detail. For this chapter, the takeaway is that **multi-GPU topology is not a choice you make casually**. The fabric dictates what's possible, and the fabric is set by the physical layout of the node and cluster.

### 6.9: Multi-GPU node topology, visualized

Finally, what does a production multi-GPU setup actually look like?

![Figure 6.10: Multi-GPU Node Topology](figures/ch06-fig9-multi-gpu-node-topology/final.png)
*Figure 6.10.* Two large rounded rectangles labeled "Node 1" and "Node 2." Each contains eight small GPU boxes arranged in a 2×4 grid, fully interconnected by thick lavender lines labeled "NVLink mesh, 900 GB/s each." Between the two nodes, a single thin dashed line labeled "InfiniBand, 50 GB/s." A callout: "Tensor parallelism stays inside one node; pipeline parallelism spans both."

Figure 6.10 shows the canonical inference-cluster architecture. Each **node** contains 8 GPUs (sometimes 4, sometimes 16) connected by a full NVLink mesh, every GPU in the node can talk to every other GPU in the node at 900 GB/sec. Between nodes, a thin but reliable InfiniBand link carries cross-node traffic.

This topology explains several production rules:

* A 70B model served with tensor-parallel 4 fits on four GPUs of a single node; no cross-node traffic.
* A 405B model (Llama 3.1 405B) does not fit on 8 × 80 GB = 640 GB, actually it does, with some quantization, so 8-way TP inside one node works.
* A trillion-parameter MoE model spans multiple nodes. Tensor parallelism must stay intra-node (within the 8-GPU NVLink mesh); pipeline parallelism crosses the InfiniBand link to reach other nodes. This is why production Llama-3.1 405B and DeepSeek-V3 deployments are 8-way TP × 2-way PP across 16 GPUs in two nodes (or equivalent configurations).

Keep Figure 6.10 in mind when we get to Chapter 16 (parallelism) and Chapter 17 (disaggregated P/D). Both chapters will reference the exact structure pictured here.

## The Machine, Summarized

### 6.10: What you now know

You can now read any GPU spec sheet and predict how it will behave for inference. Here is the checklist:

1. **HBM bandwidth** (bytes/sec), sets the slope of the roofline and the decode ITL floor.
2. **FP16 / FP8 / INT4 tensor core TFLOPS**, sets the compute ceilings. Each lower precision is a separate ceiling.
3. **SRAM per SM** (bytes), sets the working-set budget for tiled kernels like FlashAttention.
4. **Number of SMs**, sets the maximum parallelism and the minimum batch size that fully saturates the chip.
5. **NVLink bandwidth** (intra-node, bytes/sec), sets which parallelism strategies are viable within a node.
6. **InfiniBand or Ethernet bandwidth** (inter-node, bytes/sec), sets which parallelism strategies are viable across nodes.

For H100 these are: 3.35 TB/s, 989 / 1979 / 3958 TFLOPS, 228 KB SRAM/SM, 132 SMs, 900 GB/s NVLink, 50 GB/s InfiniBand. For B200 the numbers are roughly: 8 TB/s HBM (2.4×), 2250 / 4500 / 9000 TFLOPS (2.3×), 228 KB SRAM/SM (unchanged), 208 SMs (1.6×), 1800 GB/s NVLink (2×). The ratios between memory bandwidth and compute are similar across generations, both rise, and the ridge point stays roughly where it is.

### 6.11: Why this chapter is the last hardware chapter

From here on, the book assumes you can translate between hardware and inference concepts without being walked through it. When we say "the K/V cache is pressured on HBM," you know that means: the bytes are large enough to stress the 80 GB budget, and their reads dominate the memory-bandwidth term of the roofline. When we say "FlashAttention tiles into SRAM," you know it means: the N×N attention-score matrix lives in the 228 KB SRAM scratchpad of a single SM, never touching HBM. When we say "tensor parallel across 4 GPUs," you know it means: the 4 GPUs are in the same node, connected by the 900 GB/sec NVLink mesh, running AllReduce after each transformer block.

This is the vocabulary. Chapter 7 onward will use it liberally.

---

### 6.12: Where we go next

We have the machine. Chapter 7 returns to the KV cache we built in Chapter 5 and asks the next question: now that we have the cache, what does it cost? How big is it on a real model? Can we fit it in HBM? What happens when we cannot? The answer, and the techniques that respond to it, is what the next six chapters are about.

# Chapter 7: The Good and the Evil of the KV Cache

Chapter 5 derived the KV cache from first principles. Chapter 6 gave us the GPU hardware to reason about its costs. This chapter closes the loop: exactly how much FLOP work the cache saves, exactly how much HBM the cache consumes, and exactly where the savings turn into a new problem that the next six chapters are written to solve.

The title is not a metaphor. The KV cache is the single biggest inference speedup in the entire book, and it is also the single biggest source of pain that every subsequent chapter is an attempt to mitigate. The two effects are inseparable. You cannot have the FLOP savings without creating the memory pressure; the same data structure that eliminates quadratic compute is the one that linearly accumulates bytes in HBM.

Read this chapter as two complementary arguments. The first half (through §7.6) is the good, a careful accounting of what the cache buys you, at what scale. The second half (§7.7 through §7.11) is the evil, a careful accounting of what the cache costs you, and the hard question it hands to the next chapters.

---

## What the KV Cache Is, and What It Stores

### 7.1: The data structure

We said in Chapter 5 that the cache stores K and V across all past tokens. Let us make the data structure precise.

![Figure 7.1: What the KV cache actually stores](figures/ch07-fig1-what-kv-cache-stores/final.png)
*Figure 7.1.* A stacked visualization of the KV cache as a tensor of shape (N tokens, H heads, D head dimension), replicated across L transformer layers, with K and V stored separately. Annotations around the stack label each dimension: N grows one per decode step; H is the number of KV heads (architecturally fixed); D is the head dimension (architecturally fixed); L is the number of layers (architecturally fixed); K and V are stored independently.

Figure 7.1 is the data structure. For each transformer layer, we store:

* A K tensor of shape `(N, H, D)`, keys across all N past tokens, across H heads, each of dimension D.
* A V tensor of shape `(N, H, D)`, values across all N past tokens.

Each element is typically FP16 or BF16, meaning 2 bytes. Multiply across L layers and count both K and V:

```
KV cache bytes per user  =  2 (K and V)  ×  N  ×  H  ×  D  ×  L  ×  2 (FP16 = 2 bytes)
                         =  4  ×  N  ×  H  ×  D  ×  L
```

Every term except N is architecturally fixed, it is a property of the model, chosen at training time. Only N (the sequence length) grows at inference, and it grows by exactly one per decode step.

The cache is a **per-user, per-session** data structure. Each concurrent user has their own KV cache, because each user has their own conversation. When a user session ends, their cache is freed. When a new user starts, a new cache is allocated. This is why KV cache memory management, which we will see governs the concurrent-user capacity of a GPU in §7.7, becomes the central infrastructure problem of production serving.

### 7.2: The cached decode loop, one more time

Chapter 5 walked through the KV-cached decode loop algorithmically. Figure 7.2 shows the computational flow for one step.

![Figure 7.2: One decode step with the KV cache](figures/ch07-fig2-decode-with-kv-cache/final.png)
*Figure 7.2.* A horizontal flow of four boxes. (1) New input token embedding (one vector). (2) Compute Q, K, V for the new token only (one row each). (3) Append new K and V to the cache; read the full K cache and V cache. (4) Attention: Q\_new · K\_cacheᵀ, softmax, times V\_cache, produce the context vector. A small inset shows the KV cache with a freshly-appended new row highlighted.

Per decode step, the work is:

1. Take the latest generated token's embedding (shape `1 × d`).
2. Compute `q_new = x_new · W_Q`, `k_new = x_new · W_K`, `v_new = x_new · W_V`, each shape `1 × d`. These are the only fresh Q, K, V computations.
3. Append `k_new` and `v_new` to the cache, the K and V matrices grow from N rows to N+1 rows.
4. Compute attention: `q_new · K_cacheᵀ / √d = scores` (shape `1 × (N+1)`), then softmax → weights, then `weights · V_cache = context` (shape `1 × d`).
5. Apply output projection, FFN, unembedding. Sample next token. Append to output sequence.
6. Repeat.

The cached loop does exactly the same math as naive inference in terms of the final answer, but the **FLOP count per step is collapsed from O(N²·d) to O(N·d)**, because everything that depended on past Q vectors is now read from cache rather than recomputed.

---

## Quantifying the Savings and the Cost

### 7.3: FLOPs saved per decode step

Figure 7.3 compares the per-step FLOP cost of naive versus cached decode, across realistic sequence lengths.

![Figure 7.3: FLOPs per decode step: Without cache vs With cache](figures/ch07-fig3-flops-without-vs-with-cache/final.png)
*Figure 7.3.* A grouped bar chart. X-axis: sequence length N = 128, 512, 2048, 8192. Y-axis: FLOPs per step (log scale). Two bars per group: naive (O(N²·d), grows quadratically) and with KV cache (O(N·d), grows linearly). At N=8192 a bracket annotates "~8000× fewer FLOPs per step."

The comparison is stark. At N = 128, the cached version saves roughly 100× the compute of the naive version. At N = 2048, it saves ~2,000×. At N = 8192, it saves ~8,000×. **The ratio of savings is proportional to N itself.**

This is the heart of why long contexts are tractable at all. A 32K-token conversation has ~32,000× fewer per-step FLOPs under a cached decode than a naive one. Without caching, every interaction at long context would take seconds per token; with caching, it takes milliseconds. The entire practice of serving long-context LLMs is downstream of this speedup.

![Figure 7.4: KV cache speedup factor vs sequence length](figures/ch07-fig4-speedup-curve-vs-sequence-length/final.png)
*Figure 7.4.* A line chart. X-axis: sequence length N, 0 to 32,000 (linear). Y-axis: speedup factor (naive FLOPs / cached FLOPs), log scale from 1 to 100,000. A straight line rises linearly, annotated at N = 128 (128× speedup), N = 1,024 (1,024×), N = 8,192 (8,192×), N = 32,000 (32,000×). Annotation on the line: "Speedup factor = N. Doubles every time the context doubles."

Figure 7.4 makes the linear relationship explicit. The speedup factor *is* N. Double the context, double the speedup. This is the formula you carry in your head: **the KV cache is ≈N times faster than naive decode, where N is the current sequence length**. Before we celebrate too much, we should remember that this is per-step FLOP savings, not wall-clock savings. Wall-clock depends on memory bandwidth too, which is the half of the story that the next sections will break.

### 7.4: The size formula, derived carefully

Now we turn to the cost side. The formula was stated in §7.1, but it is worth deriving step by step.

![Figure 7.5: KV cache size per layer, derivation](figures/ch07-fig5-kv-cache-formula-derivation/final.png)
*Figure 7.5.* A vertical derivation with five labeled steps. Step 1: "For each token, we store both K and V." Step 2: "Each K and V has shape [H heads, D dims per head] = H·D entries." Step 3: "Across N tokens, size = N·H·D entries each." Step 4: "Across L transformer layers, multiply by L." Step 5: "Both K AND V, at 2 bytes per entry (FP16)." Formula box: "KV cache bytes = 2 × 2 × N × H × D × L." A worked example card below: "Llama-3-70B: N=32,768, H=8, D=128, L=80, FP16 → ~43 GB."

Each term in the formula comes from a distinct architectural dimension, and it is worth naming them one at a time.

* **Factor of 2 for K and V.** We store both K and V, they are independent tensors.
* **N, sequence length.** The only term that grows at inference. One new row per decode step.
* **H, number of K/V heads.** Architecturally fixed. For MHA, H equals the number of attention heads. For GQA, H is the number of groups (much smaller). For MLA, H is replaced by a different compression dimension (Chapter 8).
* **D, head dimension.** Usually 64 or 128. Architecturally fixed.
* **L, number of transformer layers.** 32 for Llama-3-8B, 80 for Llama-3-70B, 61 for DeepSeek-V3. Architecturally fixed.
* **Factor of 2 for FP16.** Two bytes per element. Quantized KV caches (Chapter 13) reduce this to 1 byte (FP8) or 0.5 bytes (INT4).

Multiplying gives the final formula:

```
KV cache bytes per user session  =  4 · N · H · D · L
```

For Llama-3-70B at N = 32,768: `4 × 32,768 × 8 × 128 × 80 = 43 GB`. That is per user. For one user, with a 32K context, the KV cache alone is more than half the size of an H100's entire HBM.

This is the number that breaks naive production deployments. An engineer picks up Llama-3-70B, sees it fits in 2 × H100 (140 GB of FP16 weights on 160 GB of HBM), and thinks the deployment is viable. Then the first user sends a long prompt, the KV cache allocates 43 GB, and the deployment falls over before the second user can connect.

### 7.5: Real-model scaling: how bad does it get?

Figure 7.6 plots the formula across the main modern open-source models.

![Figure 7.6: KV cache at real scale, N = 4096 FP16](figures/ch07-fig6-kv-cache-real-scale/final.png)
*Figure 7.6.* A horizontal bar chart, log-scale. Five bars, top to bottom. GPT-2 (124M): 12 MB. GPT-3 (175B): 2.4 GB. Llama-3 70B: 5.4 GB (at N=4K). DeepSeek-V3 with MLA: 0.6 GB. DeepSeek-V3 hypothetically with MHA: 15 GB (dashed outline).

Figure 7.6 tells the story of how the problem grew as models grew. GPT-2 (the model of 2019) has a KV cache that is a rounding error, 12 MB for 4,096 tokens. GPT-3 (2020) already hits 2.4 GB per user session, noticeable but tolerable on a 40 GB GPU of the era. Llama-3-70B (2024) is 5.4 GB at N = 4,096; at long context (N = 32K) it is 43 GB.

Look at the bottom two bars. **DeepSeek-V3 with MLA (Multi-head Latent Attention) is 0.6 GB at the same scale.** The same model *without* MLA, if they had used standard MHA, would be 15 GB. MLA gives a ~25× reduction. That is how a 671B-parameter model becomes viable for long-context serving on a feasible GPU budget: the cache is compressed by the architecture before it is even allocated.

We will spend Chapter 8 understanding MLA and the other head-compression techniques. For now, note that Figure 7.6 frames the problem: **KV cache growth has outpaced model growth**. In 2019, the cache was a footnote. In 2026, the cache is the dominant cost in most production LLM deployments, and the architectural techniques that shrink it (MLA especially) are the reason frontier long-context models are economically viable at all.

### 7.6: How many users fit on one H100?

Let us answer the question an inference engineer actually gets asked in their first week: how many concurrent users can I serve on one H100?

![Figure 7.7: H100 memory budget for Llama-3-70B inference](figures/ch07-fig7-h100-memory-budget/final.png)
*Figure 7.7.* A horizontal stacked bar representing the 80 GB of an H100's HBM, with segments labeled Model weights (70 GB, with a footnote that Llama-3-70B at FP16 is actually 140 GB and requires 2× H100 TP), Activations / workspace (5 GB), KV cache available (~5 GB). An annotation arrow points to the KV cache segment: "~5 GB / 43 GB per user = a handful of concurrent sessions!" A question card: "Q: How do you serve more users with less KV cache per user?"

Figure 7.7 performs the accounting. Llama-3-70B at FP16 has 140 GB of weights, too large for one H100, so production systems use 2-way tensor parallelism: 70 GB per GPU. The forward pass needs a few GB of activation workspace. That leaves about 5 GB per GPU for KV cache storage.

If each user's cache at N = 32K costs 43 GB, and we have 5 GB per GPU available, that is **less than one user per GPU**. The deployment is unviable for long-context use. Even at moderate context (N = 4K, 5.4 GB per user), a single GPU fits barely one concurrent user.

This is why every optimization in the following chapters exists. The 5 GB per GPU is not negotiable without quantizing the weights (Chapter 13) or sharding more aggressively (Chapter 16). The 43 GB per user is exactly what MLA, GQA, sliding window, and quantized KV cache attack. **Every byte saved per user is a new concurrent user fitted.** If we can bring per-user cache from 43 GB to 5 GB (a 9× reduction), we go from 1 to 9 concurrent users. If we can bring it to 1 GB, we get 45 concurrent users. The economics of production inference hinge on these ratios.

This also explains why DeepSeek-V3 is so important as an architectural reference. Its MLA-driven ~8-10× KV cache reduction (compared to MHA) is not just a clever trick; it is the difference between a viable production deployment and an unviable one.

### 7.7: The bandwidth problem: how the cache makes decode *more* memory-bound

So far we have counted bytes at rest. What about bytes in motion? How does the cache affect HBM traffic per decode step?

![Figure 7.8: The bandwidth problem: bytes-per-FLOP ratio grows with N](figures/ch07-fig8-bandwidth-problem-bytes-per-flop/final.png)
*Figure 7.8.* A line chart. X-axis: sequence length N, 0 to 32,768. Y-axis: bytes transferred per FLOP (lower is better, inverse of arithmetic intensity). A rising curve labeled "With KV cache, bytes per FLOP grows linearly with N." A horizontal dashed line labeled "H100 memory bandwidth limit." The curve crosses this line around N = 4K and stays above thereafter. Annotation at N = 16K: "Deep memory-bound. Every new token requires reading the entire KV cache again."

Here is a subtle fact that surprises most engineers the first time they compute it.

Per decode step, we read the entire K cache and the entire V cache from HBM, every row, every head, every layer. For Llama-3-70B at N = 32K, that is 43 GB of cache traffic **per decode step**, on top of the 140 GB of weights traffic. At H100's 3.35 TB/sec, that is `43 / 3350 = 12.8 ms` of pure cache-reading time per token, plus `140 / 3350 / 2 (TP) = 21 ms` of weight-reading time per token. **The single-user ITL floor is ~34 ms** before any optimization, and most of it is cache traffic, not weight traffic, at long context.

Worse: **as N grows, bytes grow, but FLOPs per byte do not grow proportionally**. The attention kernel's FLOPs scale as N (one new query dot-producted against N keys, times d), and the bytes-read scale as N (reading the K and V caches of length N). Ratio: FLOPs/bytes is roughly constant and small, arithmetic intensity stays around 1-2, regardless of how long the context is.

Figure 7.8 expresses this as "bytes per FLOP," which is the inverse of arithmetic intensity. At short contexts, the bytes-per-FLOP ratio is manageable. At long contexts, the ratio climbs linearly, and past a threshold (around N = 4K on H100), it exceeds what HBM bandwidth can deliver at the compute rate. The kernel becomes deeply memory-bound, with compute units idle most of the cycle.

This is the sense in which the KV cache **makes decode more memory-bound, not less**. The cache eliminates quadratic FLOPs (good) but the surviving linear FLOPs still have to be fed by reads of the linearly-growing cache (bad). Every cache-compression technique in the next chapters attacks exactly this: fewer bytes to read per step, so arithmetic intensity can stay higher.

### 7.8: The trade-off, in one table

Figure 7.9 summarizes both sides of the story.

![Figure 7.9: KV cache trade-off summary](figures/ch07-fig9-tradeoff-summary-table/final.png)
*Figure 7.9.* A two-column table. Left column "Good (what we win)." Right column "Evil (what we lose)." Five rows: (1) FLOPs drop O(N²·d) → O(N·d) | Memory bytes grow as N·H·D·L. (2) Decode latency drops ~N× | Memory footprint per user grows linearly. (3) Supports longer contexts | Fewer concurrent users fit in HBM. (4) Eliminates redundant compute | Increases bandwidth pressure; decode more memory-bound. (5) Enables interactive chat at scale | Drives need for cache compression (MQA, GQA, MLA, sliding window, quantized KV).

Figure 7.9 is the balance sheet. Each "good" is paired with the corresponding "evil", they are not independent lists, they are two sides of the same engineering object. Cells to notice:

* Row 1. We save FLOPs by caching what would otherwise be recomputed. But the cache we create must live in memory, and since we cache two full tensors (K and V) per layer per token, the bytes scale linearly with sequence length, the price of the FLOP savings.
* Row 3. Longer contexts become tractable from a compute standpoint (the O(N) per step is affordable even at 100K tokens). But the fixed 80 GB HBM budget gets eaten by the cache, leaving fewer slots for concurrent users. A system that could serve 100 concurrent users at short context serves maybe 4-5 at long context, same hardware, same model.
* Row 4. We eliminate redundant compute (the O(N²) naive cost is collapsed). But the savings move us left on the roofline: arithmetic intensity drops, bandwidth becomes the binding constraint, and every ITL improvement from here requires attacking bytes-per-token directly.

### 7.9: Where this places decode on the roofline

![Figure 7.10: KV cache on the roofline](figures/ch07-fig10-kv-cache-on-roofline/final.png)
*Figure 7.10.* The standard roofline diagram. Two labeled operating points. "Naive decode, no cache" placed at moderate arithmetic intensity, already memory-bound but closer to the ridge. "With KV cache (large N)" placed deeper in the memory-bound region, farther left. A single clean arrow from the first point to the second, labeled "KV cache shifts you LEFT." A side legend: "Less FLOPs (good), same bytes (bad) → lower AI → more memory-bound."

Figure 7.10 places the before and after on the roofline. Naive decode sits at moderate arithmetic intensity, it does O(N²) FLOPs and reads O(N) bytes, giving AI of order N, actually compute-bound for large N (if we could afford the compute, which we cannot).

Cached decode sits at AI of order 1, it does O(N) FLOPs and reads O(N) bytes, giving a constant AI regardless of context length. Deep in the memory-bound region.

This is the most important roofline movement in the book. Every subsequent chapter is, in one way or another, a response to it.

**Chapter 8** compresses the cache across attention heads. MLA, MQA, and GQA all reduce the H factor in the bytes-per-token, raising arithmetic intensity, moving the dot back toward the right.

**Chapter 9** compresses across tokens. Sliding window attention, linear attention, and state-space models reduce the N factor in the bytes-per-token, again raising AI.

**Chapter 10** moves attention into SRAM via FlashAttention. The N×N attention matrix no longer touches HBM, so one major source of byte traffic disappears entirely.

**Chapter 11** virtualizes the cache into pages (PagedAttention), eliminating the external fragmentation that otherwise limits how densely caches can pack onto a GPU.

**Chapter 12** shares caches across users (prefix caching) and chunks long prefills to avoid decode stalls.

**Chapter 13** quantizes the cache itself. An FP8 or INT4 KV cache has half or quarter the bytes of an FP16 cache.

**Chapter 14** batches concurrent user decodes so a single cache read serves many tokens, moving the dot up-right along the slope.

Every one of these techniques is a direct response to the left-shift we see in Figure 7.10. The rest of this book is the series of counter-attacks.

## The Question Every Subsequent Chapter Answers

### 7.10: "Can we have the FLOP savings without the bandwidth cost?"

Put the whole chapter in one question: **Is there a way to get the FLOP savings of the KV cache without the per-step bandwidth cost?**

The blunt answer is no, at least not completely. Any architecture that conditions the next token on past tokens must, in some form, read something proportional to past-token state. The cache's bytes are a lower bound imposed by the information the model uses.

But we can reduce the proportionality constant. Fewer heads. Smaller dimensions. Compressed latents. Quantized precision. Sliding windows. Each trades some small amount of model quality for a proportional reduction in per-step cache bytes. Stack enough of them, and you go from 43 GB per user to 1 GB per user at nearly-equal quality.

This is the program of the next six chapters, and it is why Chapter 7 ends with this question. Every technique we study from here is evaluated against two criteria: how much does it shrink the cache, and how much does it cost in model quality?

### 7.11: A note on when *not* to compress the cache

Not every deployment needs MLA or sliding window. If your context is short (under 4K), your concurrent-user load is moderate (under 20 per GPU), and your model is small (under 13B), a plain MHA cache on H100 works fine. The bandwidth pressure only becomes a real constraint when contexts are long, models are large, or concurrent loads are high.

This matters because every compression technique has a quality cost, however small. If your deployment does not need the compression, you are paying quality for a problem you do not have. A good inference engineer does not apply every optimization by default; they measure the current operating point, identify the binding constraint, and apply the minimal set of techniques that relieves it.

### 7.12: Where we go next

Chapter 8 is the first direct attack on the cache's bandwidth cost: **compressing the cache across attention heads**. We will see Multi-Query Attention (all heads share one K/V), Grouped-Query Attention (heads share in groups), and Multi-head Latent Attention (DeepSeek-V3's innovation that gives near-MHA quality at a fraction of the cache size). By the end of Chapter 8, we will have cut the H factor in the cache formula by 4× to 32× depending on which variant, and we will see exactly which modern models use which variant and why.

# Chapter 8: Compressing Across Heads, MHA → MQA → GQA → MLA

Chapter 7 closed with a question. The KV cache makes decode tractable but pressures HBM, and pressure on HBM is what now limits per-user context length and concurrent-user density. **Can we shrink the cache?**

Yes. The first direct attack is architectural: change how the heads of attention share keys and values, so that fewer K/V vectors need to be stored per token. There are four major designs in use today, introduced in historical order: Multi-Head Attention (MHA, the original), Multi-Query Attention (MQA, 2019), Grouped-Query Attention (GQA, 2023), and Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA, 2024). Each successively compresses the cache while trying to preserve the model-quality benefits of the multi-head design.

This chapter walks through all four. Each gets a figure, a numerical example, and a derivation of its per-token cache size. By the end you will know which modern model uses which variant, why Llama-3 uses GQA with 8 KV heads for 32 query heads, and why DeepSeek-V3's MLA is the most sophisticated compression technique currently in production.

## Why Head Sharing Is the First Lever

### 8.1: The cache formula, rearranged

Recall from Chapter 7 that the per-token KV cache bytes are:

```
KV bytes per token per user  =  4 · H · D · L
```

Four factors. Two bytes × 2 (K + V). H (number of KV heads). D (head dimension). L (number of layers). Multiply by sequence length N for the full per-user cache.

Of these, **H is the factor most easily shrunk**. L is fixed by architecture. D is fixed by architecture. The 4 bytes are fixed unless we quantize (Chapter 13). But H, the number of distinct K/V head-pairs, is a design choice. In the original MHA, H equals the number of attention heads. In MQA, H = 1. In GQA, H is a chosen group count between 1 and the full head count. In MLA, H is replaced by a smaller latent dimension.

Every variant in this chapter reduces the first factor, leaving the others unchanged. A 4× reduction in H (say, 32 query heads → 8 KV heads via GQA) gives a 4× reduction in cache bytes per token, which means 4× more users fit on the same GPU at the same context length. That is the economic case.

### 8.2: Why not just use fewer heads in the first place?

Before we start cutting, a reasonable question: why did MHA have multiple heads at all? Why not just one big head with a full-dimensional K and V?

Because multiple heads let the model attend to different *kinds* of relationships simultaneously. Think of the sentence "the artist painted the portrait of a woman with a brush." One head might be learning "which noun does 'with' modify" (syntactic); another might be learning "which object is a tool" (semantic); a third might be learning "what is the grammatical subject" (structural). Having 32 heads (as in Llama-3-8B) means 32 independent attention subspaces, each specialized. This multiplicity of perspectives is the reason the transformer works.

Removing heads entirely would destroy this. Merging heads aggressively would reduce the model's expressive power, and on retrieval-heavy tasks (like answering a question that requires retrieving a specific fact buried in a 10K-token context), this shows up as measurable quality regression.

So the program of this chapter is not "eliminate heads." It is: **keep the Q heads (so queries retain their diversity) but share or compress the K/V projections so the cache shrinks**. The four variants differ in how aggressively they share.

![Figure 8.1: Four ways to compress the KV cache across heads](figures/ch08-fig1-four-variants-side-by-side/final.png)
*Figure 8.1.* Four side-by-side pictograms. MHA: 8 Q circles, each paired with its own unique K/V. MQA: 8 Q circles all pointing to one shared K and one shared V. GQA: 8 Q circles grouped into 2 groups of 4, each group sharing a K/V. MLA: 8 Q circles pointing to a small "latent" block that expands to K/V on demand. Below each panel: per-token cache size formulas.

Figure 8.1 is the chapter in one picture. Four architectures, same number of Q heads, radically different KV cache sizes.

---

## One Architecture at a Time

### 8.3: MHA: Multi-Head Attention, the baseline

MHA is the original. Each of the H attention heads has its own full-dimensional K and V projection. A model with H = 32 heads and D = 128 per head has 32 independent (K, V) pairs, each of shape `(N, 128)`, stored per layer per user.

![Figure 8.2: MHA baseline: each head has its own K and V](figures/ch08-fig2-mha-baseline/final.png)
*Figure 8.2.* A standard attention diagram. Input X of shape (B, N, d) is projected via W\_Q, W\_K, W\_V into Q, K, V of shape (N, H, D). 8 head lanes are drawn, each with its own distinct Q, K, V slice. The final output is the concatenation of all head outputs projected back to model dimension.

Figure 8.2 shows MHA at batch B = 1 for clarity. The parameters are:

* `W_Q`, `W_K`, `W_V`, each of shape `(d, d)`, so `3d²` total parameters for the attention input projections.
* Each produces an output of shape `(N, H, D)` where `d = H × D`.

The per-token cache is:

```
cache_MHA  =  2 (K,V) × H × D × L × 2 bytes
            =  4 · H · D · L
```

For Llama-3-70B (if it had used MHA instead of GQA): H = 64 heads, D = 128, L = 80. Per token: `4 × 64 × 128 × 80 = 2.6 MB`. At N = 32K: `2.6 × 32,000 = 84 GB per user session`. Completely impractical, which is part of why Llama-3 uses GQA instead.

MHA is the reference design. It gives the maximum quality benefit of multi-head attention, at the maximum memory cost. Every other variant in this chapter is a response to that cost.

### 8.4: MQA: one shared K and V for all heads

MQA is the most aggressive compression. All H query heads attend to a single shared K matrix and a single shared V matrix. The K and V matrices have shape `(N, D)` rather than `(N, H, D)`.

![Figure 8.3: MQA: All heads share ONE K and ONE V](figures/ch08-fig3-mqa/final.png)
*Figure 8.3.* Same layout as MHA but with 8 Q head lanes all converging into a single K vector and a single V vector. Thick lines show all Q's feeding into one shared K/V.

Figure 8.3 makes the sharing visual. The parameter count drops: `W_K` and `W_V` shrink from `(d, d)` to `(d, D)` (one head's worth of output dimension). The input projection becomes `d² + 2dD` rather than `3d²`.

The per-token cache shrinks by a factor of H:

```
cache_MQA  =  2 (K,V) × 1 × D × L × 2 bytes
            =  4 · D · L
```

For Llama-3-70B-sized architecture (if MQA had been used): `4 × 128 × 80 = 40 KB per token`. At 32K: `40 × 32,000 = 1.3 GB per user`. A **32× reduction** from MHA.

That is extreme. It should feel too good. It is.

The problem is quality. With only one K/V pair, all heads must attend to the same pattern of importance across the context. The "different perspectives" story that justifies multi-head attention collapses. Empirically, MQA causes a measurable but not catastrophic drop on retrieval-heavy benchmarks, roughly 0.5-2 perplexity points on standard evaluations, and larger regressions on needle-in-haystack tasks where a specific token needs to be retrieved from a long context.

MQA was introduced by Noam Shazeer in 2019 and was used in some early deployments (PaLM, StarCoder) but is rarely used in modern frontier models. It trades too much quality for too much memory savings. The next variant, GQA, gives you most of the memory savings without most of the quality loss.

### 8.5: GQA: grouped-query attention, the pragmatic middle

GQA is MQA's more careful cousin. Instead of 1 shared K/V for all H Q heads, we have `G` K/V groups, where each group serves `H/G` query heads. G is the tunable knob, G = 1 gives MQA, G = H gives MHA, and the interesting regime is somewhere in between.

![Figure 8.4: GQA: heads grouped, each group shares K and V](figures/ch08-fig4-gqa/final.png)
*Figure 8.4.* 8 Q head lanes grouped into 2 clusters of 4. Each cluster converges into one shared K and one shared V. The 4 Q heads within a group each attend to the same K/V pair, but different groups have different K/V.

Figure 8.4 shows G = 2 with H = 8, four Q heads per group, two groups total. The per-token cache formula adjusts:

```
cache_GQA  =  2 (K,V) × G × D × L × 2 bytes
            =  4 · G · D · L
```

For Llama-3-70B with the real architecture (G = 8 groups for H = 64 Q heads): `4 × 8 × 128 × 80 = 320 KB per token`. At 32K: `320 × 32,000 = 10 GB per user`. That is an **8× reduction** from MHA (84 GB → 10 GB).

GQA is the default choice for almost every 2024-2026 frontier open-source model: Llama-3 (all sizes, G = 8), Qwen-2 and 3 (G = 4), Mistral-Large (G = 8), Command-R (G = 4). The reason is that GQA hits an excellent point on the quality-memory Pareto frontier: it keeps most of MHA's quality while paying a fraction of the memory.

![Figure 8.5: KV cache bytes per token across variants (H=32, D=128)](figures/ch08-fig6-kv-bytes-per-token-bar/final.png)
*Figure 8.5.* A horizontal bar chart, linear scale. Four bars: MHA 16,384 bytes per token, GQA (G=8) 4,096 bytes, MQA (G=1) 512 bytes, MLA (R=512) 1,024 bytes. MLA bar annotated "Bytes low AND quality preserved."

Figure 8.5 puts numbers on all four variants at a common architecture (H = 32, D = 128). MHA is the baseline at 16 KB per token. GQA (G = 8) is 4 KB, 4× less. MQA is 512 bytes, 32× less. MLA (we will see) is around 1 KB, 16× less, **but without the quality regression that MQA incurs**.

### 8.6: Why Llama chose G = 8

Llama-3's specific choice (G = 8 KV heads for 32 query heads, ratio 4:1) is not accidental. Figure 8.6 shows what it came from.

![Figure 8.6: Why Llama chose GQA with 8 KV heads for 32 query heads](figures/ch08-fig8-llama-gqa-choice/final.png)
*Figure 8.6.* Two side-by-side panels. Left: "Perplexity vs number of KV heads", a descending curve showing perplexity drops steeply from 1 KV head to 4 KV heads, then flattens from 8 to 32. Right: "KV cache bytes vs number of KV heads", a linear rising line from 1 to 32. Both panels have a vertical dashed line at G = 8, labeled "Llama-3 choice: G = 8 → 4× cache reduction, negligible perplexity loss."

Figure 8.6 reports empirical ablations (simplified for clarity, but matching the pattern documented in the Llama-2 paper and subsequent GQA benchmarks). Perplexity drops fast from G = 1 to G = 4, then flattens. By G = 8, the perplexity gap against full MHA is within noise, you cannot measure the quality difference in practice. Meanwhile, cache size grows linearly with G, so larger G costs memory without buying quality.

The sweet spot is the left edge of the perplexity plateau. For a 32-head architecture, G = 8 sits right there: quality essentially identical to MHA, cache 4× smaller. For different architectures, the sweet spot shifts slightly, Qwen-2 went with G = 4 for smaller models, but the principle holds. You are looking for the smallest G where perplexity has plateaued.

This is an inference-engineering decision embedded in model architecture. Every inference engineer should be able to look at a model's reported `num_key_value_heads` and `num_attention_heads`, compute the ratio, and know how aggressively the model compressed its cache.

### 8.7: MLA: the best of both worlds

Multi-head Latent Attention is the newest and most sophisticated of the four. It was introduced by DeepSeek in 2024 (first in DeepSeek-V2, refined in V3). Unlike GQA, which reduces cache by sharing across heads, MLA reduces cache by **compressing K and V into a lower-dimensional latent space before storage**.

![Figure 8.7: MLA: Latent compression with the absorption trick](figures/ch08-fig5-mla-absorption-trick/final.png)
*Figure 8.7.* A three-stage horizontal pipeline. Stage 1: input token x of shape (1, d\_model). Stage 2: latent projection c\_KV = x · W\_DKV of shape (1, R), where R << d. Stage 3: at attention time, up-projections K = c\_KV · W\_UK and V = c\_KV · W\_UV reconstruct per-head K and V. A separate formula box shows the absorption trick: Q · K^T = (x · W\_Q) · (c\_KV · W\_UK)^T can be rewritten so that K is never materialized at decode time, only the latent c\_KV is cached.

Figure 8.7 is MLA. The sequence is:

1. **Down-project.** For each token, multiply the input x by a smaller weight matrix W\_DKV (shape `d × R`, where R is the latent rank, typically 512) to produce a latent vector c\_KV of shape `(1, R)`. Cache this latent vector instead of full K and V.
2. **Up-project (lazily).** When we need K and V for attention, multiply c\_KV by up-projection matrices W\_UK and W\_UV (shape `R × d`) to reconstruct per-head K and V. In principle this adds compute overhead.
3. **The absorption trick.** We can mathematically merge the up-projection W\_UK into the query projection W\_Q, so that K is never actually reconstructed at decode time. The attention score computation becomes:

```
scores = Q · K^T = (x · W_Q) · (c_KV · W_UK)^T = x · (W_Q · W_UK^T) · c_KV^T
```

The term `W_Q · W_UK^T` is a constant matrix that can be precomputed once at model-load time. Call it `W_Q_absorbed`. Then:

```
scores = x · W_Q_absorbed · c_KV^T
```

The cached quantity is only `c_KV` (small), never full K (large). The same trick works for V during the final weighted-sum step.

The per-token cache is:

```
cache_MLA  =  R × L × 2 bytes  (only c_KV, not full K and V)
            =  2 · R · L
```

For DeepSeek-V3 (R = 512, L = 61): `2 × 512 × 61 = 62 KB per token`. For the same architecture's hypothetical MHA (H = 128, D = 128): `4 × 128 × 128 × 61 = 4 MB per token`. **MLA reduces the cache by ~64× relative to MHA**, without losing per-head diversity (the up-projection W\_UK still produces distinct per-head K vectors during the score computation, they are just not stored).

![Figure 8.8: DeepSeek-V3 MLA vs MHA compression comparison](figures/ch08-fig9-mla-compression-ratio/final.png)
*Figure 8.8.* Two horizontal bars for the same model capacity. Top: MHA hypothetical, 80 GB KV cache at 32K context. Bottom: MLA actual, 10 GB KV cache. The second bar is 1/8 the length. Annotation: "~8× reduction with NO loss in downstream evaluation quality."

Figure 8.8 shows the production impact. DeepSeek-V3, at its full parameter count (671B total, 37B active), is economically serveable precisely because MLA brings its 32K-context cache from ~80 GB per user down to ~10 GB per user. Without MLA, the model would be effectively inaccessible at long context.

The quality story is the other half. On standard benchmarks (MMLU, HumanEval, long-context retrieval tests), MLA-equipped models match or exceed MHA-equipped ones of the same parameter count. The per-head diversity is preserved by the up-projection; the cache compression comes at almost zero quality cost. This is the sense in which MLA is Pareto-optimal, it dominates MQA on both axes, and matches GQA on quality while beating it significantly on memory.

### 8.8: The Pareto frontier

Figure 8.9 plots all four variants in a quality-versus-memory scatter.

![Figure 8.9: Quality vs KV memory, the Pareto frontier](figures/ch08-fig10-quality-vs-memory-scatter/final.png)
*Figure 8.9.* A scatter plot. X-axis: KV cache memory (relative to MHA), log scale 0.03 to 1.0. Y-axis: downstream task quality (e.g., MMLU score) from 60 to 80. Four labeled points: MHA top-right (full memory, full quality). GQA (G=8) middle, small penalty. MQA (G=1) bottom-left (tiny memory, visible quality drop). MLA upper-left, highlighted with a star, near-MHA quality at a fraction of the memory. A dashed Pareto frontier curve passes through MHA, MLA, and GQA, but NOT MQA.

Figure 8.9 summarizes the choice. If you can only pick one variant for your serving stack:

* **For a small model (7B-13B) with moderate context (up to 8K) and modest concurrency needs:** MHA is fine; the cache is not yet the binding constraint.
* **For a standard deployment (~70B model, ~32K context, dozens of concurrent users on a single node):** GQA with G = 8 is the default. Minimal quality cost, 4-8× cache reduction. This is what Llama-3-70B uses.
* **For very long context, high concurrency, or extreme efficiency:** MLA is the winner if you have a model trained with it (DeepSeek-V3, or anyone else who adopts the architecture). It gives you cache savings comparable to MQA with quality indistinguishable from MHA.
* **MQA is only defensible in heavily memory-constrained edge deployments** where quality is not the top priority.

### 8.9: A note on parameter count

Cache bytes are not the same as parameter count. Figure 8.10 shows the parameter story for the four variants.

![Figure 8.10: Parameter count comparison: attention block only](figures/ch08-fig7-parameter-count-comparison/final.png)
*Figure 8.10.* A vertical bar chart. Four bars showing parameter count for a single attention block at d = 4096, H = 32. MHA: 3 × d² = 4.2B parameters (if scaled to full model). MQA: 2.3B. GQA (G = 8): 3.0B. MLA: 2.5B.

Figure 8.10 shows that the parameter savings from GQA/MQA/MLA are much smaller than the cache savings (roughly 30-45% reduction vs 4-64× reduction). The reason is that the Q projection (W\_Q, shape `d × d`) is unchanged across all variants, only the K and V projections shrink. Since W\_Q is the largest of the three, total parameter count does not drop dramatically.

The takeaway: **the cost of these variants is paid at training time, not at parameter-count time**. The gains are inference-time cache reductions. Do not optimize your variant choice for total parameter count; optimize for per-token cache bytes, which is what Figure 8.5 tracks.

## Where Head Compression Places Us on the Roofline

### 8.10: The operating point, after GQA or MLA

Recall from Chapter 7 that the KV cache pushed decode left on the roofline, into deeper memory-bound territory, because bytes scaled with N while FLOPs stayed at O(N·d).

Head compression attacks one term in the bytes formula. The factor H (or R for MLA) is reduced by 4× (GQA), 32× (MQA), or ~64× (MLA). Bytes per step go down proportionately. Arithmetic intensity, which is FLOPs divided by bytes, goes **up** proportionately, because FLOPs are roughly unchanged (the attention kernel still operates on the same-shape intermediate tensors during the forward pass, just from compressed cached sources).

In roofline terms: **each variant moves the decode dot to the right**, back toward the ridge. The more aggressive the compression, the further right the dot moves.

Does it reach the ridge? No, not alone. Even MLA's 64× compression leaves arithmetic intensity in the single digits, still memory-bound, just less so. To reach the ridge, head compression has to be combined with the other techniques of Chapters 9-14 (sliding window, flash attention, continuous batching, speculative decoding). Each is additive; together they collapse the bandwidth gap.

### 8.11: What head compression does not solve

Two costs remain after head compression.

First, **the cache still grows linearly with N**. We have reduced the per-token byte count but not eliminated the N factor. A 100K-token session still pressures HBM more than a 4K session, just less absolutely. Chapter 9 attacks the N term directly via sliding window, linear attention, and state-space models.

Second, **the cache still lives in HBM**. Even a compressed cache must be read from HBM on every decode step. FlashAttention (Chapter 10) does not shrink the cache but rearranges *where* it lives during the attention kernel, keeping parts in SRAM to avoid repeated HBM reads. This is orthogonal to compression and combines with it multiplicatively.

### 8.12: Where we go next

Chapter 9 is the second direct attack on the cache size: **compressing across tokens, not heads**. We will see sliding window attention (each token attends only to a fixed window W of past tokens), linear attention (a constant-size running state instead of N-linear growth), state-space models (recurrent formulations that can be parallelized), and Mamba (the selective SSM that makes recurrence competitive with attention). Each attacks the N factor in the cache formula, in some cases eliminating it entirely.

Chapter 8 shrinks the head count. Chapter 9 shrinks the sequence count. Together they bring the KV cache from "unmanageable" to "manageable," at which point the remaining chapters (flash attention, paged attention, prefix caching, quantization, batching) can make the cache usage actually efficient.

# Chapter 9: Compressing Across Tokens, Sliding Window, Linear Attention, State Space Models, and Mamba

Chapter 8 cut the KV cache by a factor of 4 to 64 by compressing across heads. That is a large win, but it leaves one factor untouched: **the cache still grows linearly with the sequence length N**. A 100K-token session still has 25× the cache bytes of a 4K-token session, no matter what head-sharing strategy you pick. GQA and MLA do not help with long context per se; they help *with* long context by reducing bytes per token, but the linear-in-N growth is still there.

This chapter attacks N itself. Four architectural families, each with a different mechanism for eliminating or bounding the N factor in the cache.

* **Sliding window attention** caps the cache at a constant W regardless of total sequence length.
* **Linear attention** collapses the cache into a constant-size D×D state matrix that does not grow with N at all.
* **State space models (SSMs)** reformulate attention as a linear recurrence with a fixed-size hidden state.
* **Mamba** is a selective SSM that makes the recurrence input-dependent, closing most of the quality gap to full attention.

Each family comes with a specific trade-off between memory savings and retrieval quality. This chapter walks through all four, derives why they work, and ends with an honest discussion of where each one wins and where it fails. It is long because the mathematics here is genuinely interesting and each architecture demands a careful explanation, not just "sliding window attends to the last W tokens" but *why* that is enough for most tasks, where the receptive field goes, and how the layer stack recovers effective long-range dependence.

---

## The Token-Length Problem

### 9.1: Why compressing across tokens is fundamentally harder

Head compression (Chapter 8) is mathematically safe. MLA, in particular, proves that you can compress the K/V storage without losing the multi-head diversity that justifies attention in the first place. The per-head projections are preserved; only the stored representation is compressed. Model quality is essentially unchanged.

Token compression is a different beast. The N tokens of a sequence each carry distinct information; the model cannot attend to information it has not stored. If we cap the cache at W past tokens (sliding window), we have erased information about tokens beyond W positions back. If we collapse past tokens into a constant-size state (linear attention or SSM), we have lossy-compressed them, different past token sequences can collide into the same state, and the model cannot recover what it has lost.

The question each technique has to answer is: **for the tasks we care about, how much does this information loss hurt?** The empirical answer varies enormously by task. For most language modeling (the loss we train against), token-level retrieval from very old context is not what drives perplexity. For some downstream tasks, reading a long document and answering a factoid question, retrieval from old context is exactly the thing.

This is why the four architectures in this chapter coexist rather than one replacing the others. Each one hits a different point on the quality-memory trade-off, and the right choice depends on what the downstream workload actually needs.

![Figure 9.1: Four paradigms for compressing attention across tokens](figures/ch09-fig1-four-paradigms-at-a-glance/final.png)
*Figure 9.1.* A 2×2 grid. Top-left: full attention, N×N matrix, O(N²) cost. Top-right: sliding window, narrow diagonal band, O(N·W) cost. Bottom-left: linear attention, constant D×D state. Bottom-right: SSM/Mamba, recurrence diagram with fixed-size hidden state.

Figure 9.1 is the chapter in miniature. Full attention (top-left) is the reference: every token attends to every past token. Sliding window (top-right) limits each token to the last W. Linear attention (bottom-left) reorders the matrix algebra so past information collapses into a fixed D×D state. SSMs and Mamba (bottom-right) use recurrence to fold all past information into a small hidden state that updates per step.

All four reduce cache bytes by attacking the N factor. They differ in how they approximate the attention that full attention would have computed, and therefore in which kinds of information they preserve or lose.

---

## Four Architectures, In Order of Compression Aggressiveness

### 9.2: Sliding window attention

The simplest of the four. Each token attends only to a fixed window W of past tokens (plus itself). Beyond position `i - W`, the past is invisible.

![Figure 9.2: Sliding window attention, W = 4](figures/ch09-fig2-sliding-window-attention/final.png)
*Figure 9.2.* An 8×8 attention mask matrix. Cells in a diagonal band of width W = 4 are filled (the token at position i attends to positions i-3, i-2, i-1, i); all other cells are empty. Row and column labels 1-8. Annotation: "Token at position i attends only to positions [i-3, i, i-1, i]."

Figure 9.2 shows the structure. The attention mask, which in full attention is a lower triangular matrix (causal mask, tokens see only their past), becomes a narrow diagonal band. Outside the band, attention is zero; the token has no information flow from older positions.

This is a hard constraint at the *layer* level. A single sliding-window layer cannot look more than W tokens back. But deep architectures stack many layers, and layer stacking expands the effective receptive field multiplicatively.

#### 9.2.1: KV cache savings

For sliding window attention with window W, the per-user cache is:

```
cache_SW  =  4 · W · H · D · L
```

Replacing the N in the formula with W, which is constant in user sessions (typically 4K). At N = 100K on a model with W = 4K, the cache is 25× smaller than full MHA:

```
reduction  =  N / W  =  100,000 / 4,000  =  25×
```

![Figure 9.3: Sliding window KV cache as a circular buffer](figures/ch09-fig3-sliding-window-kv-cache/final.png)
*Figure 9.3.* A ring of 8 cache slots with a pointer showing the current write position. As the sequence grows beyond 8, the oldest slot is overwritten by the newest. The annotation card on the right: "Buffer size W. Memory is constant regardless of total sequence length."

Figure 9.3 makes the savings visual. The KV cache becomes a **circular buffer** of fixed size W. As new tokens arrive, the oldest token's K and V slots are overwritten. The cache never grows past W slots. This is the critical property: you can run an infinitely long session and the cache never exceeds the W-token budget.

#### 9.2.2: Receptive field from layer stacking

The apparent limitation, only W tokens visible per layer, is not as severe as it looks at first glance. Deep models stack many layers, and each layer's attention operates on the output of the previous layer. Tokens in layer 2 have been influenced by their W neighbors in layer 1, and through that influence they carry traces of W additional tokens further back.

![Figure 9.4: Receptive field via layer stacking (W = 4, L = 3)](figures/ch09-fig4-receptive-field-via-layer-stacking/final.png)
*Figure 9.4.* Three stacked layers. Each layer's token sees the last 4 tokens of the previous layer. At position 12 in layer 3, tracing back through the layers shows that layer 3 has indirect access to tokens 9-12 (direct), which had access to tokens 5-12 (layer 2), which had access to tokens 1-12 (layer 1). Effective receptive field at depth L: approximately W × L.

Figure 9.4 makes the math concrete. A token at position 12 in layer 3, attending to positions 9-12 in layer 2. Those layer-2 tokens each attended to 4 earlier positions in layer 1 (back to position 5 for position 9, which attended to 5-8 of layer 1; position 10 attended to 6-9 of layer 1; etc.). So layer 1 positions 5 through 12 are in the effective receptive field of layer 3 position 12. Going one layer deeper, positions back to 1 are reachable.

The effective receptive field from layer stacking is approximately `W × L`. For Mistral-7B (W = 4K, L = 32), the effective receptive field is `4K × 32 = 128K tokens`. This is much larger than W alone. A sliding-window model with enough depth *can* see very far back, just with indirect influence rather than direct attention.

In practice, direct attention is still strictly stronger than indirect-through-layers attention. The information flow through L layers is filtered through each layer's attention kernel, and information about a specific old token is attenuated by the layers. On retrieval-heavy benchmarks (needle-in-a-haystack tasks), sliding-window models at W = 4K struggle beyond ~10K context, even at layer counts that would theoretically give 128K receptive field.

#### 9.2.3: Who uses sliding window

Mistral-7B (2023) was the first production model to popularize sliding window, with W = 4,096. Gemma-2 and Gemma-3 from Google adopted it with a twist: they **mix sliding-window layers with full-attention layers** (e.g., every 5th layer is full attention). This hybrid pattern gets the memory savings of sliding window most of the time while retaining some direct long-range pathways.

Mistral-Large dropped sliding window in favor of GQA for its 123B model, partly because long-context retrieval was a product requirement. This is the honest summary of where sliding window sits: great for chatty applications with moderate context, increasingly replaced by GQA+MLA or hybrid architectures when long-context retrieval matters.

### 9.3: Linear attention

Sliding window hard-clips the receptive field at W tokens. Linear attention is a different approach: keep seeing all past tokens, but compress them into a **constant-size state** that does not grow with N. The cache, in linear attention, is not N rows, it is a fixed D × D matrix, independent of sequence length.

The mechanism relies on an algebraic reordering that only works when you remove the softmax from attention.

![Figure 9.5: Linear attention: the kernel trick](figures/ch09-fig5-linear-attention-kernel-trick/final.png)
*Figure 9.5.* Left: the standard attention formula `softmax(Q·K^T) · V`, showing the O(N²·d) cost of materializing the N×N attention matrix. An arrow labeled "remove softmax, use kernel feature map φ(·)" points right. Right: the linear attention formula `φ(Q) · (φ(K)^T · V)`, showing how associativity lets us compute the D×D inner product first, reducing cost to O(N·D²).

Figure 9.5 is the key algebraic insight. In standard attention:

```
output  =  softmax(Q · K^T / √d) · V
        =  A_weights · V            where A_weights is (N, N)
```

We compute Q · K^T first (an N×N matrix), apply softmax row-wise, then multiply by V. The N×N matrix is unavoidable because softmax is a row-wise nonlinearity, it mixes all entries in each row, forbidding us from reordering the matmuls.

Linear attention replaces softmax with a kernel feature map φ, chosen so the attention can be written as:

```
output  =  φ(Q) · (φ(K)^T · V)         [by associativity]
        =  φ(Q) · S                     where S = φ(K)^T · V is (D, D)
```

The trick: because there is no softmax, we can compute `φ(K)^T · V` first, a D×D matrix, and then multiply `φ(Q)` by it. The N×N matrix never materializes. Per decode step, we need only the D×D matrix S, which is the entire "cache" for this mechanism.

#### 9.3.1: The running state

For causal (autoregressive) decoding, the state S is accumulated incrementally. At each new token t, we update:

```
S_t  =  S_{t-1}  +  φ(K_t)^T · V_t      (outer product, shape D×D)
z_t  =  z_{t-1}  +  φ(K_t)              (running normalizer, shape D)
```

Then the attention output for token t is:

```
attention_t  =  (φ(Q_t) · S_t)  /  (φ(Q_t) · z_t)
```

Two running quantities: S (a D×D matrix) and z (a D-vector). Both have constant size regardless of how far back the context extends.

![Figure 9.6: Linear attention running state](figures/ch09-fig6-linear-attention-running-state/final.png)
*Figure 9.6.* A horizontal timeline of 6 tokens. Above each token, a D×D "state" box updating incrementally. The state at token t is the state at t-1 plus an outer product `φ(K_t) · V_t^T`. A side card: "State size = D². Does not grow with t. This IS the compression."

Figure 9.6 shows the state update visually. Unlike the KV cache which grows linearly with N, the linear-attention state is a fixed-size matrix that is updated in place. The bytes are `D × D × 2 (FP16) = D²·2` bytes per layer. For D = 128, L = 32: `128 × 128 × 2 × 32 = 1 MB per user session, total, for the whole sequence at any length`. That is roughly 10,000× smaller than the full MHA cache on a long context.

#### 9.3.2: The context bottleneck

That compression is profound, and the cost is equally profound. The state S is a lossy fixed-size summary of all past tokens. Different past sequences can produce the same S, so the model cannot recover specific past tokens exactly. The attention becomes, effectively, a **context-averaged** retrieval, the state has summed up all past (key, value) pairs, weighted only by the kernel map and the token's own identity.

Two immediate consequences:

**First, all past tokens contribute equally.** There is no notion of "pay more attention to the last mentioned character in a story." Every past token's contribution to S is the same outer product; the model cannot upweight important ones and downweight noise.

**Second, information can be erased.** If two recent tokens have key vectors that point in opposite directions, their outer products in S partially cancel. The older token's information is obscured by the newer one's. In softmax attention, this cancellation does not happen, the softmax normalizes within a row, keeping all past tokens' contributions distinct.

The consequence in practice: **linear attention performs noticeably worse than softmax attention on retrieval-heavy tasks**, particularly ones requiring the model to remember a specific piece of information mentioned once, far back in the context. On perplexity and general language modeling, the gap is smaller. On needle-in-a-haystack benchmarks, the gap can be dramatic.

Various attempts have been made to fix this, RetNet adds a decay factor that weights recent tokens more; GLA (Gated Linear Attention) adds a learned gate that controls what gets written to S. These partial mitigations soften the context-bottleneck problem without eliminating it. The fundamental tension, constant-size state versus infinite past, is intrinsic to the approach.

#### 9.3.3: When linear attention wins

Linear attention is the right choice when you need constant-memory-per-user inference at very long context, and the workload does not require precise retrieval of old specific tokens. Streaming applications (voice transcription, real-time captioning) can benefit because the state is small and bounded. For chat or code generation where the user might reference something they said 30 turns ago, linear attention struggles.

Modern production LLMs mostly do not use pure linear attention. But its mathematical structure, running state instead of growing cache, is the foundation of SSMs and Mamba, which we see next.

### 9.4: State space models

Linear attention and state-space models are algebraically very close. The main differences are (a) SSMs explicitly formulate the state update as a recurrence, borrowing terminology from control theory; (b) SSMs use a time-invariant transition matrix A that gives recent tokens more weight than older ones, which addresses one of linear attention's weaknesses; (c) SSMs can be formulated as a convolution, which lets them be trained in parallel like a transformer.

The SSM recurrence is:

```
h_t  =  A · h_{t-1}  +  B · x_t
y_t  =  C · h_t  +  D · x_t
```

Where:
- `x_t` is the input token (a vector of dimension d).
- `h_t` is the hidden state (a vector of dimension `d_state`, typically 16-128).
- `A` is the state-transition matrix `(d_state, d_state)`, usually parameterized to have eigenvalues less than 1 so old state information decays.
- `B` maps input into state; `C` maps state into output; `D` is a direct input-to-output skip.

![Figure 9.7: SSM formulation](figures/ch09-fig7-ssm-formulation/final.png)
*Figure 9.7.* Two equivalent views of the same mechanism. Left: a recurrence diagram with hidden states h\_1, h\_2, h\_3, ... connected by solid A arrows, input x\_t feeding in through B, output y\_t coming out through C. Right: the convolutional kernel view, `y = x * K` where `K = [C·B, C·A·B, C·A²·B, ...]`, showing the SSM can be expressed as a 1D convolution over the input sequence.

Figure 9.7 shows the two equivalent views of an SSM. The recurrence view (left) makes it look like a traditional recurrent neural network, sequential state updates. The convolution view (right) says something powerful: because the recurrence is linear, the output `y` is a convolution of the input `x` with a fixed kernel `K = [C·B, C·A·B, C·A²·B, ...]`. This convolution can be computed in parallel via FFT, making training fast.

This dual nature, recurrence at inference time, convolution at training time, is what distinguishes SSMs from RNNs. At training, you parallelize via FFT. At inference, you run the recurrence step by step, with constant-size hidden state `h`. No KV cache growing with N.

![Figure 9.7.0: Recurrence view vs. convolution view of the same SSM](figures/ch09-fig12-ssm-as-convolution/final.png)
*Figure 9.7.0.* Left panel: the recurrence view — a vertical chain of hidden-state boxes h\_0, h\_1, h\_2, h\_3 with A-multiplications flowing down and x\_t inputs feeding in through B, outputs y\_t emerging via C. Right panel: the convolution view — the kernel K = [C·B, C·A·B, C·A²·B, …] slid across the input sequence, all N outputs computed in parallel via FFT. Centered arrow between panels: "Same math, two computation orders. Linearity is what makes both possible." Side note: "RNNs can't do this — tanh(a+b) ≠ tanh(a) + tanh(b), so the recurrence never unrolls into a fixed kernel."

#### 9.4.1: The decay term

Because A has eigenvalues less than 1, applying `h_t = A · h_{t-1} + B · x_t` exponentially decays old information. Tokens from `t - 20` steps back contribute with weight `A^20 · x_{t-20}`, which is small. Tokens from `t - 2` contribute with weight `A^2 · x_{t-2}`, which is larger. This is exactly the opposite of linear attention, which treats all tokens equally.

This is both a strength and a weakness. Strength: the model naturally focuses on recent context, which is often what matters. Weakness: information genuinely useful from far back is lost to the decay.

#### 9.4.2: KV cache size

The SSM "cache" is the hidden state `h` of size `d_state` per layer per user. At `d_state = 64` and L = 32 layers:

```
cache_SSM  =  d_state × L × 2 bytes  =  64 × 32 × 2  =  4 KB per user session, total.
```

Four kilobytes. At any sequence length. For comparison, full MHA on Llama-3-70B at N = 32K is ~43 GB per user. SSMs compress by a factor of roughly **10,000×**.

Unsurprisingly, this compression is lossy. SSMs with `d_state = 64` cannot preserve the full context information of a 32K-token sequence. But for many tasks, the recent-focus bias and the small-state summary are sufficient.

#### 9.4.3: A four-token SSM recurrence, traced by hand

Formulas are abstract. The only way to *feel* what a hidden state is doing is to run the recurrence on concrete numbers. We use a toy SSM with `d = 4`, `d_state = 4`, and a diagonal transition matrix A (the standard parameterization used by S4 and Mamba).

**Setup.**

```
A (diagonal)  = diag(0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6)          ← four different decay rates

Row 2:-0.2·1.0 + 0.3·0.0 + 0.4·0.5 + 0.1·0.2    =-0.20 + 0 + 0.20 + 0.02 = 0.02

h_0 = [0.48, 0.06, 0.02, 0.49]
```

Apply `C·h_0 + D·x_0` to get output `y_0`:

```
C·h_0 row 0: 0.5·0.48 + 0.2·0.06 + (-0.3)·0.02 + 0.1·0.49 = 0.295
        row 1: -0.1·0.48 + 0.4·0.06 + 0.6·0.02 + (-0.2)·0.49 = -0.110
        row 2: 0.3·0.48 + (-0.2)·0.06 + 0.1·0.02 + 0.5·0.49  = 0.379
        row 3: 0.2·0.48 + 0.3·0.06 + (-0.1)·0.02 + 0.4·0.49  = 0.308
D·x_0    = 0.1·[1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.2] = [0.100, 0.000, 0.050, 0.020]

y_0 = [0.395, -0.110, 0.429, 0.328]
```

**Step t = 1.** The diagonal A scales each dimension of the previous state by its own decay factor:

```
A·h_0 = [0.9·0.48, 0.8·0.06, 0.7·0.02, 0.6·0.49] = [0.432, 0.048, 0.014, 0.294]
B·x_1 = [0.19, 0.53, 0.26, −0.03]          (same pattern as step 0)
h_1   = A·h_0 + B·x_1 = [0.622, 0.578, 0.274, 0.264]
```

Notice dim 0 of `h_1` carries 0.432 of the earlier state plus 0.19 of the new input. The state is a weighted mixture.

**Steps t = 2 and t = 3** (same mechanics, compressed):

```
h_2 = [1.050, 0.752, 0.292, 0.528]
h_3 = [1.155, 0.742, 0.644, 0.347]
y_3 = [0.588, 0.548, 0.517, 0.539]
```

**The information decay table.** Track how much of the *original* `x_0` signal survives in the state after each step. Because A is diagonal, the `x_0` contribution to `h_t` is just `A^t · (B·x_0)`:

| Step | dim 0 (A=0.9) | dim 1 (A=0.8) | dim 2 (A=0.7) | dim 3 (A=0.6) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| t=0 | 0.480 (100%) | 0.060 (100%) | 0.020 (100%) | 0.490 (100%) |
| t=1 | 0.432 ( 90%) | 0.048 ( 80%) | 0.014 ( 70%) | 0.294 ( 60%) |
| t=2 | 0.389 ( 81%) | 0.038 ( 64%) | 0.010 ( 49%) | 0.176 ( 36%) |
| t=3 | 0.350 ( 73%) | 0.031 ( 51%) | 0.007 ( 34%) | 0.106 ( 22%) |
| t=7 | 0.229 ( 48%) | 0.013 ( 21%) | 0.002 ( 8%) | 0.017 ( 3%) |

![Figure 9.7.2: Exponential decay of x_0's signal across four state dimensions](figures/ch09-fig7-2-ssm-decay-per-dim/final.png)
*Figure 9.7.2.* A line chart with four curves, one per state dimension. X-axis: time step t from 0 to 7. Y-axis: fraction of x\_0's original contribution remaining (0–1). The curves decay at different rates: dim 0 (A=0.9) falls slowly, still at 48% at t=7; dim 3 (A=0.6) falls quickly, down to 3% at t=7. Annotation: "Each state dimension specializes in a different memory timescale."

Two observations fall out of the table.

First: the SSM uses *different state dimensions for different memory timescales*. Dim 0 (A = 0.9) is long-range memory; it still retains 48% of `x_0` seven steps later. Dim 3 (A = 0.6) is short-range; it has only 3% left. A well-trained SSM spreads information across these timescales intelligently — facts that matter for a long time end up in the slow-decay dims.

Second: the convolution kernel `K_t = C·A^t·B` falls out directly from this trace. Summing across all input tokens:

```
y_t  =  K_t · x_0  +  K_{t-1} · x_1  +  ...  +  K_0 · x_t
```

This is an ordinary 1D convolution. Training-time, all N outputs can be computed in parallel via FFT in `O(N log N)`. Inference-time, the recurrence runs in `O(1)` per step with a fixed-size state. **Same model, two computation orders** — the strength that RNNs never had (because `tanh` breaks linearity, `tanh(a + b) ≠ tanh(a) + tanh(b)`, so RNNs cannot be unrolled into a convolution).

### 9.5: Mamba: selective SSMs

Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2024) is the most widely adopted SSM variant. Its contribution: making the SSM **input-dependent**.

In a standard SSM, the transition matrices A, B, C, D are *fixed*, learned once during training and applied identically to every input. Mamba makes them functions of the current input:

```
h_t  =  A_t · h_{t-1}  +  B_t · x_t    where A_t, B_t depend on x_t
y_t  =  C_t · h_t
```

The parameters of the recurrence now vary per token, which means the model can **selectively** remember or forget as the input dictates.

![Figure 9.8: Mamba: Selective SSM, A, B, C depend on input](figures/ch09-fig8-mamba-selective-ssm/final.png)
*Figure 9.8.* Two side-by-side panels. Left: standard SSM with fixed A, B, C drawn as static boxes. Right: Mamba with A\_t, B\_t, C\_t drawn as functions of x\_t, shown with input-dependent arrows. A central annotation: "The transition matrices are now functions of the current input. This lets the model selectively forget or remember based on content."

Figure 9.8 illustrates the shift. In a standard SSM, if the model wants to "reset" its state when a new sentence starts, it cannot, A is fixed. In Mamba, if the current token looks like a sentence-ending period, A\_t can be chosen to near-zero out the state, effectively clearing memory. If the current token is informative, B\_t can amplify its contribution.

![Figure 9.8.0: The full Mamba block, step by step](figures/ch09-fig11-mamba-block-architecture/final.png)
*Figure 9.8.0.* An eight-stage vertical pipeline showing the complete Mamba block: (1) linear projection split into branches x' and z, (2) Conv1D over x' for local context, (3) SiLU activation, (4) selective parameter heads computing Δ\_t, B\_t, C\_t from x' per token, (5) discretization (A, Δ\_t) → A\_bar\_t and (Δ\_t, B\_t) → B\_bar\_t, (6) the selective SSM recurrence itself h\_t = A\_bar\_t · h\_{t-1} + B\_bar\_t · x'\_t, y\_t = C\_t · h\_t, (7) gating — y\_t multiplied elementwise by SiLU(z), (8) output projection + residual. Stages 4–6 highlighted as "the selective core"; stages 1–3 and 7–8 are standard neural-net machinery. This eight-stage block replaces both attention and FFN of a transformer layer.

This selectivity is the reason Mamba closes much of the retrieval gap with full attention. On needle-in-a-haystack tasks, Mamba performs substantially better than fixed SSMs or linear attention, not as well as full attention, but surprisingly close for a recurrence-based mechanism.

The implementation detail matters. Mamba cannot be expressed as a fixed convolution anymore (because A\_t varies with t), so the convolution-based parallel training trick does not apply directly. Instead, Mamba uses a **parallel scan**, a divide-and-conquer algorithm that computes the recurrence in `O(log N)` parallel depth at training time. Inference is still O(N) sequential, exactly as with a standard SSM.

#### 9.5.1: Mamba's memory footprint

Mamba's state size is typically larger than a standard SSM (`d_state = 16` × expansion factor of 2 × d, giving effective state ~128-256 dimensions per layer). Per-user cache for a Mamba-2 at d = 4096, state expansion = 128:

```
cache_Mamba  ≈  d_state · L · 2 bytes  ≈  128 × 64 × 2  =  16 KB per user
```

Still massively smaller than full MHA. Large enough to do meaningful retrieval.

#### 9.5.2: Selectivity traced on a real sentence

To see why input-dependent dynamics matter, run Mamba's recurrence on the sentence `"The capital of France is"`. We use a 1-dimensional state (`n = 1`) and a continuous-time `A = -1.0`. Each token `x_t` projects to a learned **Δ\_t** (the "time-step", which controls how much of the past to forget and how much of the input to admit):

```
Token          Δ_t    meaning
"The"          0.5    common word, moderate writing
"capital"      1.0    content word, write more
"of"           0.05   function word, nearly skip
"France"       2.0    key entity, heavy reset
"is"           0.3    structural, moderate
```

Discretization turns Δ\_t into per-token state-transition factors:

```
A_bar_t = exp(A · Δ_t) = exp(-Δ_t)     (fraction of old state retained)
B_bar_t = 1 - A_bar_t                   (fraction of new input admitted)
```

| Token | Δ | A\_bar | B\_bar | Interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| "The" | 0.5 | 0.607 | 0.393 | 61% keep, 39% write |
| "capital" | 1.0 | 0.368 | 0.632 | 37% keep, 63% write (push) |
| "of" | 0.05 | 0.951 | 0.049 | 95% keep, 5% write (skip) |
| "France" | 2.0 | 0.135 | 0.865 | 14% keep, 87% write (reset) |
| "is" | 0.3 | 0.741 | 0.259 | 74% keep, 26% write |

![Figure 9.8.1: Mamba's input-dependent A_bar and B_bar across one sentence](figures/ch09-fig8-1-mamba-delta-trace/final.png)
*Figure 9.8.1.* A horizontal strip of 5 token boxes for "The capital of France is." Under each box, two stacked bars: A\_bar (keep-fraction, blue) and B\_bar (write-fraction, orange). "of" is nearly all blue (almost no writing); "France" is nearly all orange (state reset). A separate panel on the right: a contrast with a **fixed** SSM using constant A\_bar = 0.8, showing every token gets the same stacked bar regardless of content. Annotation: "Mamba's dynamics depend on the token; a fixed SSM's do not."

**State evolution step by step** (with `val(·) = 1.0` for all tokens — all content is encoded in Δ, B, C, not in the input value):

```
h_init = 0

"The":     h_0 = 0.607·0 + 0.393·1 = 0.393
"capital": h_1 = 0.368·0.393 + 0.632·1 = 0.145 + 0.632 = 0.777
"of":      h_2 = 0.951·0.777 + 0.049·1 = 0.739 + 0.049 = 0.788   ← barely moved
"France":  h_3 = 0.135·0.788 + 0.865·1 = 0.106 + 0.865 = 0.971   ← reset!
"is":      h_4 = 0.741·0.971 + 0.259·1 = 0.720 + 0.259 = 0.979
```

"of" enters the state at 4.9% strength and leaves the old state 95.1% intact — the model effectively ignored it. "France" crushes the old state down to 10.6% of itself and writes its own signal at 86.5% — a near-total reset triggered by a content word.

**Composition of the final state h\_4.** We decompose `h_4` by which token contributed what, using the chain `B_bar_t · val_t · ∏_{s>t} A_bar_s`:

```
"The":     0.393 · (0.368·0.951·0.135·0.741) = 0.393 · 0.035 = 0.014    ( 1.4%)
"capital": 0.632 · (0.951·0.135·0.741)       = 0.632 · 0.095 = 0.060    ( 6.1%)
"of":      0.049 · (0.135·0.741)             = 0.049 · 0.100 = 0.005    ( 0.5%)
"France":  0.865 · (0.741)                   = 0.865 · 0.741 = 0.641    (65.5%)
"is":      0.259 · (1.0)                     = 0.259 · 1.000 = 0.259    (26.5%)
                                                              ───────
                                                              sum = 0.979 ✓
```

**Compare to a fixed SSM** with constant A\_bar = 0.8 (no content-based gating):

```
"The":     0.012 (12.8%)
"capital": 0.016 (16.0%)
"of":      0.020 (20.0%)   ← "of" outweighs "capital" purely because of recency
"France":  0.025 (25.0%)
"is":      0.031 (31.2%)   ← newest token always wins
```

In the fixed SSM, importance equals recency. A meaningless function word ("of") ends up with a bigger share of the state than a content word that came before it ("capital"). The model has no way to tell them apart — they all get the same decay. This is exactly the failure mode that makes fixed SSMs lose to transformers on retrieval tasks.

Mamba fixes it: **content determines importance, not just position**. "France" holds 65.5% of the final state despite being two positions back; "of" holds 0.5% despite being more recent than "capital" (6.1%). The learned Δ head looked at "of", decided it didn't need to go into long-term storage, and kept the previous state nearly frozen. The same head looked at "France", decided it was the subject of the sentence, and overwrote the state to make room.

This single trick — per-token, input-dependent discretization — is what lifts Mamba's retrieval quality from ~40% (linear attention / fixed SSM level) to ~78% on needle-in-a-haystack benchmarks. The downside, as noted in §9.5: A\_t is no longer constant, so the FFT-based parallel convolution used by fixed SSMs doesn't apply. Mamba substitutes a **parallel scan** algorithm for training, which keeps `O(log N)` parallel depth but is harder to implement efficiently. This is why production support for Mamba lags behind Llama-style transformers.

### 9.6: The memory comparison, across all four

Figure 9.9 puts the per-token memory of all four paradigms on a single chart.

![Figure 9.9: Memory per token, across paradigms](figures/ch09-fig9-memory-per-token-bar-chart/final.png)
*Figure 9.9.* A horizontal bar chart, log-scale. Five bars for a model at d = 4096 and N = 32,000. MHA (full): ~256 KB per layer per token. Sliding window (W = 4096): ~32 KB (roughly 8× less). Linear attention: ~32 KB independent of N. SSM/Mamba (d\_state = 64-128): ~2 KB total for the whole sequence. Vanilla RNN: ~2 KB total. Mamba is about 128× smaller per sequence than full attention at long context.

Figure 9.9 tells the story. Full MHA's per-token cost scales with `H·D·L`. Sliding window caps it at `W` in the sequence dimension. Linear attention and SSM/Mamba both reduce to a fixed size that does not grow with N, SSM's size is especially small because `d_state` is typically much smaller than `D × H`.

The trade-off axis is quality. Figure 9.10 shows a hypothetical but representative ranking.

![Figure 9.10: Retrieval quality on needle-in-haystack](figures/ch09-fig10-needle-in-haystack-retrieval/final.png)
*Figure 9.10.* A bar chart showing retrieval accuracy (0-100%) for five architectures on a 32K-context needle-in-haystack benchmark. Full attention: 95%. Sliding window W=4K: 45% (drops sharply beyond window). Linear attention: 40% (context bottleneck). Mamba: 78% (selectivity helps). Hybrid (Mamba + attention layers): 92% (best of both).

Figure 9.10 reports a stylized but empirically-grounded pattern from the SSM literature. Full attention is the gold standard at 95%. Sliding window degrades sharply past the window (45%). Linear attention suffers from the context bottleneck (40%). Mamba's selectivity recovers most of the gap (78%). **Hybrid architectures, mixing Mamba layers with full-attention layers, hit 92%, nearly matching full attention with massively lower memory**.

This is why modern research increasingly points to hybrid architectures. Jamba (AI21), Zamba, and the research-grade Mamba-Attention hybrids all adopt this pattern: most layers are Mamba or SSM (for memory and throughput), a few layers are full attention (for retrieval). The few attention layers are typically placed at specific positions, middle layers, where the model needs to synthesize information globally, rather than distributed evenly.

### 9.7: Implementation complexity

A word of warning that is often omitted. Full attention is deeply supported in inference libraries: FlashAttention exists, PagedAttention exists, every production engine has a tuned kernel. Sliding window is well-supported too (Mistral's kernels are widely adopted).

Linear attention, SSMs, and Mamba are much less well-supported in production stacks as of 2026. FlashAttention for SSMs exists (FlashSSM) but is newer and less battle-tested. PagedAttention-equivalent techniques for SSMs are nascent. Continuous batching with Mamba is implemented in specific engines (Tri Dao's Mamba codebase, llama.cpp recently) but not universally.

For a production deployment in 2026, the architecture choice is constrained by what your serving engine supports. If you are running vLLM, GQA or MLA are the safe bets. If you are willing to use experimental engines, Mamba variants offer dramatic memory savings. Hybrid models (Jamba, Zamba, future hybrid Llamas) may become the default if and when serving support catches up.

---

## Where Token Compression Places Us on the Roofline

### 9.8: What changes on the roofline

Sliding window, linear attention, SSMs, and Mamba all attack the cache's byte dimension. By reducing bytes per decode step, each one **raises arithmetic intensity**, the operating point moves right on the roofline.

The magnitude varies. Sliding window's cache at W = 4K, compared to full MHA at N = 32K, is 8× smaller. Arithmetic intensity rises by ~8×. Still memory-bound, but less deeply.

Linear attention and SSMs: the cache is **constant-sized**. AI rises dramatically, at very long context, roughly N× compared to full MHA. For an SSM at N = 32K, that is ~32× more FLOPs per byte than MHA. In practice, SSMs at long context are compute-bound rather than memory-bound, the opposite regime from every other technique in this book.

Mamba sits between full attention and linear attention in both memory and quality.

### 9.9: What does not change

Token compression does not help the other terms in the cache formula. Head compression (Chapter 8) still applies orthogonally, you can combine GQA with sliding window (as Mistral does), or MLA with an SSM layer. These are additive.

Token compression also does not eliminate the need for efficient attention kernels. Even with a constant-size state, you still have to compute `φ(Q) · S` efficiently, which benefits from tiling and quantization. The techniques of Chapters 10-15 still apply.

### 9.10: The modern picture

As of 2026, the dominant production pattern for long-context inference is:

1. GQA or MLA for head compression (Chapter 8).
2. Full attention for most layers, possibly with sliding window on some layers.
3. FlashAttention kernel (Chapter 10) for efficient attention computation.
4. PagedAttention (Chapter 11) for KV cache memory management.
5. Prefix caching and chunked prefill (Chapter 12) for serving efficiency.
6. Quantization (Chapter 13) for both weights and KV cache.
7. Continuous batching (Chapter 14) for throughput.

Mamba-style architectures are emerging for streaming and very-long-context applications but have not yet displaced attention as the default. The research-to-production gap is real and closing.

### 9.11: Where we go next

Chapters 8 and 9 gave us two ways to shrink the bytes in the cache. Chapter 10 gives us a way to avoid moving those bytes through HBM at all, by keeping the attention computation local in SRAM: **FlashAttention**. Combined with head and token compression, FlashAttention completes the memory-traffic story for attention itself. After that, Chapter 11 addresses the other major memory concern, how the cache is laid out across GPU HBM, and Chapter 12 addresses how to share cache state across users.

# Chapter 10: FlashAttention

Chapters 8 and 9 attacked the *size* of the KV cache. FlashAttention attacks a different target: the *memory traffic* that happens during the attention kernel itself, independent of how large or small the cache is.

To see why this matters, recall what happens during a decode step. The model reads the KV cache from HBM. It loads Q, K, V into on-chip memory. It computes the attention scores (`Q · Kᵀ`), applies softmax, multiplies by V to get the context vector. Then it writes the context vector back. The total bytes moved across HBM for this one operation can be much larger than the cache itself, because the intermediate tensors, the N×N score matrix, the N×N weight matrix, get materialized and re-read as the kernel runs.

FlashAttention's insight is that these intermediate tensors **do not need to live in HBM at all**. They can be computed tile by tile inside the on-chip SRAM, consumed, and discarded, never written to HBM, never read back. The only HBM traffic is for Q, K, V coming in, and the context vector going out. Everything else happens on-chip.

The result is a dramatic reduction in attention's memory footprint during execution. On H100 with a 4K-token context, FlashAttention reduces attention's HBM traffic by roughly 10×, which translates into a 2-4× end-to-end speedup on attention-heavy workloads. At long context (32K+), the speedup is larger.

This chapter walks through exactly how that works, the tiling strategy, the online softmax trick that makes tiled attention mathematically correct, and the I/O complexity analysis that quantifies the gain. We also trace the evolution from FlashAttention-1 (2022) through FlashAttention-3 (2024), because each version extracts more of the GPU's peak by exploiting hardware features the previous version did not use.

## Standard Attention's HBM Traffic Problem

### 10.1: What standard attention actually does to HBM

Before diving into the fix, let us be precise about what standard attention does wrong. The attention computation has three matrix products:

1. `scores = Q · Kᵀ / √d`, producing an N×N score matrix.
2. `weights = softmax(scores)`, also N×N.
3. `context = weights · V`, producing N×d.

In a naive implementation (which is more or less what PyTorch's default attention does before `torch.compile`), each of these products is computed as a separate CUDA kernel. That means:

* Kernel 1 reads Q and K from HBM, writes the N×N scores matrix to HBM.
* Kernel 2 reads scores from HBM, writes the N×N weights matrix to HBM.
* Kernel 3 reads weights and V from HBM, writes context to HBM.

![Figure 10.1: Standard attention: too many HBM round trips](figures/ch10-fig1-standard-attention-hbm-traffic/final.png)
*Figure 10.1.* A vertical flow of six alternating boxes. HBM (writes Q, K, V). Compute (reads Q and K, computes scores). HBM (writes N×N scores). Compute (reads scores, softmax). HBM (writes N×N weights). Compute (reads weights and V, produces output). Annotation: "3 full reads + 3 full writes of O(N²) matrices to HBM."

Figure 10.1 shows the traffic. Six round trips to HBM, with the N×N matrix moving through HBM twice, once as scores, once as weights. At N = 4096 and 2 bytes per element, the N×N matrix is `4096² × 2 = 32 MB per attention layer per forward pass per user`. Over 32 layers, that is ~1 GB per forward pass just for attention-intermediate tensors, all moving through HBM at 3.35 TB/s.

The attention kernel itself does relatively few FLOPs (proportional to `N²·d` during prefill, `N·d` during decode), but moves enormous byte volume. This is a textbook memory-bound kernel. The compute is idle most of the time while data moves.

### 10.2: The real problem: the N×N matrix does not fit in SRAM

Why do we write the N×N score matrix to HBM at all? Because it is too large for on-chip memory. The H100 SM has 228 KB of SRAM; the N×N matrix at N = 4096 is 32 MB, roughly 140× larger. Even a smaller chunk, the portion handled by one SM's thread block, is typically several MB. There is no way to keep the whole thing on-chip.

![Figure 10.2: The real problem: the N×N scores matrix blows up](figures/ch10-fig2-n-squared-matrix-problem/final.png)
*Figure 10.2.* A central visual of an N×N matrix grid with N = 4096. The annotation "4096 × 4096 × 2 bytes = 32 MB per attention layer per sequence." A comparison box next to it: "L = 32 layers → 1 GB total. SRAM per SM = 228 KB." A big arrow labeled: "The N×N matrix is ~140,000× bigger than SRAM can hold. It MUST live in HBM under standard attention."

Figure 10.2 shows the mismatch. 32 MB of N×N matrix versus 228 KB of SRAM per SM. The standard solution is "just put it in HBM and move on." FlashAttention's solution is: "don't produce the full N×N matrix at all. Produce one small tile of it at a time, use it, discard it."

This is deeply non-trivial because **softmax is row-wise**, and a row of the N×N matrix spans all N keys. You cannot just compute one tile of scores without information about all the other tiles, the softmax normalization requires summing `exp(score)` across the full row. Some mathematical trick is needed to make tile-by-tile softmax work. That trick is **online softmax**.

## The FlashAttention Algorithm

### 10.3: The core idea: tile Q, K, V into SRAM

![Figure 10.3: FlashAttention's idea: tile Q, K, V into SRAM](figures/ch10-fig3-flash-attention-idea-tile-into-sram/final.png)
*Figure 10.3.* A split figure. Left half "Standard attention" showing Q, K, V in HBM and an enormous N×N scores matrix being materialized in HBM. Right half "FlashAttention" showing Q, K, V still in HBM but small colored tiles being loaded into SRAM one at a time. The N×N scores matrix does NOT exist in HBM; it is computed tile by tile inside SRAM and discarded. Central annotation: "The N×N scores matrix is never written to HBM. Only small tiles exist briefly inside SRAM."

Figure 10.3 is the core idea. Instead of computing the full N×N matrix and then iterating over it, FlashAttention:

1. Divides Q into `B_r` row-blocks and K, V into `B_c` column-blocks, where the block sizes fit the SRAM budget.
2. For each Q block, iterates over all K and V blocks.
3. For each (Q block, K block, V block) triple: loads them into SRAM, computes the partial score matrix for that tile, applies a running-softmax update, accumulates the partial output for that Q block.
4. After all K/V blocks have been processed for a given Q block, writes the final output block to HBM.

The key property: **the N×N score matrix never exists in HBM**. Only small tiles of it exist briefly in SRAM, and they are overwritten each iteration. HBM only sees Q, K, V going in and O going out.

Figure 10.4 shows the tile structure at a concrete scale.

![Figure 10.4: Tiling grid: 8×8 attention, 2×2 tile grid](figures/ch10-fig4-tiling-grid/final.png)
*Figure 10.4.* An 8×8 attention matrix divided into a 2×2 grid of 4×4 tiles, each tile in a different color. Q row-blocks (Q\_1 rows 0-3, Q\_2 rows 4-7) label the left side. K column-blocks label the top. Each of the 4 tiles is named by its (row\_block, col\_block) index. Annotation: "FlashAttention processes tiles in an outer loop over Q blocks, inner loop over K/V blocks."

Figure 10.4 shows a toy 8×8 attention broken into 4 tiles of 4×4 each. In practice, block sizes are chosen based on SRAM, typical production numbers are `B_r = 128` for Q and `B_c = 64` for K, giving 8K-element tiles that comfortably fit in H100's 228 KB SRAM.

The question is: given that softmax requires full-row normalization, how does tile-by-tile computation produce correct softmax output?

### 10.4: The online softmax trick

Online softmax is the mathematical foundation that makes tiled attention work. It answers: *given a partial sum so far, how do we update it when a new tile arrives with its own partial contributions?*

Standard softmax:

```
softmax(x_1, ..., x_N)_i  =  exp(x_i) / sum_{j=1..N} exp(x_j)
```

In numerical implementations, for stability, we subtract the max:

```
m = max(x_1, ..., x_N)
softmax(x_1, ..., x_N)_i  =  exp(x_i - m) / sum_{j=1..N} exp(x_j - m)
```

Now suppose we have processed tiles 1 through t, and we know:
- `m_t` = max of all scores seen so far
- `l_t` = sum of `exp(score_j - m_t)` for all j seen so far
- `o_t` = partial output vector so far (weighted sum of V values)

A new tile t+1 arrives with:
- `m'` = max of scores in this tile
- `l'` = sum of `exp(score_j - m')` for this tile's scores
- `o'` = partial output of this tile (scores × V for this tile)

We need to merge these. The online-softmax update:

```
m_new  =  max(m_t, m')
l_new  =  exp(m_t - m_new) · l_t  +  exp(m' - m_new) · l'
o_new  =  exp(m_t - m_new) · o_t  +  exp(m' - m_new) · o'
```

After the last tile, the final output is `o_last / l_last`.

![Figure 10.5: The online softmax trick](figures/ch10-fig5-online-softmax/final.png)
*Figure 10.5.* A left-to-right flow showing running state updates across two tiles. After tile 1, state is (m\_1, l\_1, o\_1). Tile 2 arrives with its own (m\_2, l\_2, o\_2). A merge formula box shows m\_new = max(m\_1, m\_2); scale\_1 = exp(m\_1 - m\_new); scale\_2 = exp(m\_2 - m\_new); l\_new = l\_1·scale\_1 + l\_2·scale\_2; o\_new = o\_1·scale\_1 + o\_2·scale\_2. Annotation: "Each tile contributes to a running max, sum, and output. Softmax ends up correct without materializing the full row."

Figure 10.5 shows the mechanism. The "state" is just three numbers (per attention query row): a running max `m`, a running sum `l`, and a partial output vector `o`. Each incoming tile updates these three using the exponential rescaling shown in the figure.

Mathematical correctness: the final softmax is exact. The scaling factors `exp(m_t - m_new)` ensure that when a new tile brings a larger max, the old contributions are rescaled to the new reference point. This is equivalent to shifting all the exponent arguments, which cancels out of the final ratio.

Numerical stability: subtracting the max before exponentiating keeps the exponent arguments bounded by 0 from above, which prevents overflow. This was already standard practice in batch softmax; online softmax simply makes it incremental.

### 10.5: Tile-by-tile walkthrough

Let us trace two tiles to make it concrete.

![Figure 10.6: Tile (Q1, K1): first tile, initialize state](figures/ch10-fig6-tile-0-0-walkthrough/final.png)
*Figure 10.6.* A four-step breakdown for the first tile. Step 1: load Q1, K1, V1 from HBM into SRAM. Step 2: compute S = Q1 · K1ᵀ inside SRAM. Step 3: row-wise max m\_1, sum l\_1, partial output o\_1. Step 4: write state to HBM, discard SRAM tiles.

For the first tile (Q block 0, K block 0, V block 0):

1. Load Q\_1 (shape `B_r × d`), K\_1 (shape `B_c × d`), V\_1 (shape `B_c × d`) from HBM into SRAM. Total load: `(B_r + 2·B_c) · d · 2 bytes`.
2. Compute scores for this tile: `S_1 = Q_1 · K_1ᵀ / √d`, shape `(B_r, B_c)`, all in SRAM.
3. For each row of Q\_1, compute:
   - `m_1[i] = max(S_1[i, :])`, local max
   - `l_1[i] = sum(exp(S_1[i, :] - m_1[i]))`, local sum of exponentials
   - `o_1[i] = sum_j exp(S_1[i, j] - m_1[i]) · V_1[j, :]`, partial output
4. Write the state `(m_1, l_1, o_1)` back to HBM for this Q block.

Second tile, K block 1 for the same Q block:

![Figure 10.7: Tile (Q1, K2): second tile, update running state](figures/ch10-fig7-tile-0-1-walkthrough/final.png)
*Figure 10.7.* Four-step breakdown for the second tile. Step 1: load Q1 (already cached), K2, V2 (new), and prior state (m\_1, l\_1, o\_1) from HBM. Step 2: compute S = Q1 · K2ᵀ in SRAM. Step 3: local m\_2, l\_2. Merge with prior state via online softmax rules to produce (m\_new, l\_new, o\_new). Step 4: write new state back to HBM.

Same structure, but now we have prior state to merge with. The merge uses the online softmax update formulas from §10.4. When all K blocks have been processed for this Q block, the final `o / l` is the exact attention output for this Q block.

Note that Q\_1 only needs to be loaded once, it stays in SRAM for the entire inner loop over K/V blocks. The K and V blocks are loaded fresh each iteration.

### 10.5.1: A full numerical walkthrough on a toy 8×8 attention

Formulas alone do not build intuition. We now run FlashAttention end-to-end on a toy attention head where every matrix element is small enough to trace by hand. The structure of this example is identical to what happens on Llama-3-70B at `N = 131,072`; only the dimensions are different.

**Setup.** One head, sequence length `N = 8`, head dimension `d = 4`, block sizes `B_q = B_kv = 4`. The scaling factor is `1/√d = 0.5`. The 8×8 score matrix splits into a 2×2 grid of 4×4 tiles.

```
Q (8×4):                  K (8×4):                  V (8×4):
 1.0  0.5  0.0  0.2        0.8  0.3  0.1  0.4        1.0  0.0  0.5  0.2
 0.3  1.0  0.4  0.1        0.2  0.9  0.5  0.3        0.3  0.8  0.1  0.6
 0.7  0.2  0.8  0.5        0.6  0.1  0.7  0.8        0.7  0.3  0.9  0.1
 0.1  0.6  0.3  0.9        0.4  0.7  0.2  0.6        0.2  0.5  0.4  0.8
 0.5  0.3  0.7  0.4        0.9  0.4  0.3  0.1        0.6  0.2  0.7  0.3
 0.8  0.1  0.2  0.6        0.1  0.8  0.6  0.5        0.4  0.7  0.2  0.9
 0.2  0.7  0.5  0.3        0.5  0.2  0.4  0.7        0.8  0.1  0.6  0.4
 0.4  0.5  0.1  0.8        0.3  0.6  0.8  0.2        0.5  0.4  0.3  0.7
```

![Figure 10.6.A: Toy QKV matrices and the 2×2 tile grid](figures/ch10-fig6a-toy-qkv-matrices/final.png)
*Figure 10.6.A.* Three 8×4 matrices Q, K, V displayed side by side with their numerical values, color-banded into the two 4-row Q blocks and 4-row KV blocks. To the right, an 8×8 attention grid overlaid with a 2×2 tile boundary, labeled `(Q₀, K₀)`, `(Q₀, K₁)`, `(Q₁, K₀)`, `(Q₁, K₁)`. Annotation: "FlashAttention will process this grid tile by tile; the full 8×8 scores matrix never exists in HBM."

**Standard attention reference (row 0).** We first compute what row 0 of the output *should* be, using standard attention, so we can verify FlashAttention reproduces it exactly.

Row 0 of `S = Q · Kᵀ / √d`, with `Q[0] = [1.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.2]`, dot product against each K row then scaled by 0.5:

```
S[0] = [0.515, 0.385, 0.405, 0.435, 0.560, 0.300, 0.370, 0.320]
```

Row-wise softmax: max is 0.560 at position 4. Subtracting and exponentiating:

```
exp(S[0] - 0.560) = [0.956, 0.839, 0.856, 0.882, 1.000, 0.771, 0.827, 0.787]
sum = 6.919
P[0] = [0.138, 0.121, 0.124, 0.127, 0.145, 0.111, 0.120, 0.114]   (sums to 1.0)
```

Finally `O[0] = P[0] · V`, the 8-way weighted sum of V rows:

```
O[0][0] = 0.138·1.0 + 0.121·0.3 + 0.124·0.7 + 0.127·0.2
        + 0.145·0.6 + 0.111·0.4 + 0.120·0.8 + 0.114·0.5
        = 0.571
```

So the standard-attention answer for row 0 of the output starts with **0.571**. Remember that number.

**FlashAttention, Tile (Q₀, K₀).** Load Q₀ = Q[0:4], K₀ = K[0:4], V₀ = V[0:4] into SRAM. Initialize running state:

```
m_0 = [-∞, -∞, -∞, -∞]    (one per Q row)
l_0 = [ 0,  0,  0,  0]
O_0 = zeros(4, 4)
```

Compute `S_tile = Q₀ · K₀ᵀ · 0.5` in SRAM (128 FLOPs):

```
S_tile (4×4):
  [ 0.515  0.385  0.405  0.435 ]   ← Q row 0
  [ 0.325  0.580  0.385  0.465 ]   ← Q row 1
  [ 0.475  0.385  0.605  0.430 ]   ← Q row 2
  [ 0.305  0.490  0.360  0.505 ]   ← Q row 3
```

This 4×4 tile lives only in SRAM. It is never written to HBM. That is the first piece of the saving.

Row-wise max and running state update:

```
m_tile = rowmax(S_tile) = [0.515, 0.580, 0.605, 0.505]
m_new  = max(m_0, m_tile) = [0.515, 0.580, 0.605, 0.505]   (first tile, m_0 was -∞)

P_tile = exp(S_tile - m_new)
       = [[1.000, 0.878, 0.896, 0.923],   ← row 0
          [0.775, 1.000, 0.823, 0.891],
          [0.878, 0.803, 1.000, 0.839],
          [0.819, 0.985, 0.865, 1.000]]

l_0 = [0, 0, 0, 0] + rowsum(P_tile) = [3.697, 3.489, 3.520, 3.669]

O_0 = P_tile · V_0
Row 0: [1.000·[1.0,0.0,0.5,0.2] + 0.878·[0.3,0.8,0.1,0.6]
        + 0.896·[0.7,0.3,0.9,0.1] + 0.923·[0.2,0.5,0.4,0.8]]
     = [2.075, 1.433, 1.763, 1.555]   (unnormalized, per-row partial)
```

State after tile (0,0) for row 0: `m = 0.515`, `l = 3.697`, `O = [2.075, 1.433, 1.763, 1.555]`.

**FlashAttention, Tile (Q₀, K₁) — the correction fires.** Load K₁ = K[4:8], V₁ = V[4:8]. Q₀ is already in SRAM and we reuse it.

```
S_tile = Q₀ · K₁ᵀ · 0.5:
  [ 0.560  0.300  0.370  0.320 ]   ← Q row 0 attending to K rows 4-7
  [ 0.290  0.420  0.310  0.395 ]
  [ 0.465  0.385  0.460  0.465 ]
  [ 0.225  0.435  0.335  0.325 ]

m_tile = [0.560, 0.420, 0.465, 0.435]
m_new  = max(m_0, m_tile) = [0.560, 0.580, 0.605, 0.505]
                             ^^^^^
                             row 0 promoted from 0.515 to 0.560
```

This is the key moment. Row 0's old accumulations were built against max = 0.515. The new tile has uncovered a larger value, 0.560. We must rescale the old work. The correction factor for row 0 is:

```
correction[0] = exp(m_0 - m_new) = exp(0.515 − 0.560) = exp(−0.045) = 0.956
correction    = [0.956, 1.000, 1.000, 1.000]
```

Rows 1–3 are unaffected (their old max still holds, so `exp(0) = 1`). Only row 0 gets a sub-unit correction.

```
P_tile = exp(S_tile - m_new):
  [ 1.000  0.771  0.827  0.787 ]   ← row 0 under new max 0.560
  [ 0.748  0.852  0.763  0.831 ]
  [ 0.870  0.803  0.865  0.870 ]
  [ 0.756  0.932  0.844  0.835 ]

l_new = correction · l_0 + rowsum(P_tile)
      = [0.956, 1.000, 1.000, 1.000] · [3.697, 3.489, 3.520, 3.669]
      + [3.385, 3.194, 3.408, 3.367]
      = [3.534, 3.489, 3.520, 3.669] + [3.385, 3.194, 3.408, 3.367]
      = [6.919, 6.683, 6.928, 7.036]
```

Compare row 0: online softmax gives `l[0] = 6.919`, exactly matching the standard-attention sum computed above. No approximation — the correction factor `exp(-0.045) = 0.956` rescales the old tile's contribution to the new reference point, and the old sum of 3.697 becomes `0.956 · 3.697 = 3.534`, which added to the new tile's 3.385 gives precisely 6.919.

Update the output accumulator similarly:

```
O_new[0] = correction[0] · O_0[0] + P_tile[0] · V_1
         = 0.956 · [2.075, 1.433, 1.763, 1.555]
         + [1.000·[0.6,0.2,0.7,0.3] + 0.771·[0.4,0.7,0.2,0.9]
            + 0.827·[0.8,0.1,0.6,0.4] + 0.787·[0.5,0.4,0.3,0.7]]
         = [1.984, 1.370, 1.685, 1.487] + [1.964, 1.138, 1.586, 1.876]
         = [3.948, 2.508, 3.271, 3.363]
```

After the inner loop over K blocks finishes for Q block 0, we divide by the final `l` to get the normalized output for this Q block:

```
O_final[0] = O_new[0] / l_new[0] = [3.948, 2.508, 3.271, 3.363] / 6.919
           = [0.571, 0.362, 0.473, 0.486]
```

The first element is **0.571** — bit-for-bit identical to the standard-attention answer we computed at the start. FlashAttention is not an approximation. It computes the exact same output, just with 67% less HBM traffic because the 4×4 `S_tile` and `P_tile` never touched HBM.

![Figure 10.6.B: Online softmax correction across two tiles](figures/ch10-fig6b-online-correction-trace/final.png)
*Figure 10.6.B.* A two-panel diagram tracing row 0's state across tiles. Panel 1 "After tile (Q₀,K₀)" shows the state triple (m=0.515, l=3.697, O=[2.075, 1.433, 1.763, 1.555]) beside the P\_tile matrix. Panel 2 "After tile (Q₀,K₁)" shows the correction factor 0.956 highlighted in red, the state triple updated to (m=0.560, l=6.919, O=[3.948, 2.508, 3.271, 3.363]), and a dashed arrow from the old O values scaled by 0.956 to the new values. At the bottom a "Final normalize" box: `O/l = [0.571, 0.362, 0.473, 0.486]`, with "Matches standard attention exactly" stamped underneath.

**I/O ledger on the toy example.** Count the HBM bytes for each method:

![Figure 10.6.C: HBM I/O timeline — standard attention vs FlashAttention](figures/ch10-fig11-standard-attention-hbm-trace/final.png)
*Figure 10.6.C.* Two horizontal timelines stacked. Top: "Standard attention, 6 HBM round-trips" — Q/K/V writes (192 B), Q/K reads (128 B), write S 8×8 (128 B), read S + write P (256 B), read P/V (192 B), write O (64 B). Cumulative = 768 B. The S/P round-trips highlighted in rust and tagged "intermediate, discarded". Bottom: "FlashAttention, 4 HBM round-trips, same FLOPs" — Q block (32 B), K/V\_0 (64 B), K/V\_1 (64 B), O write (32 B), plus re-reads for Q block 2. Cumulative = 384 B. A side bar chart: 768 B vs 384 B, with "0.50× HBM traffic, identical 1,152 FLOPs."

| Metric | Standard | FlashAttention | Ratio |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| HBM reads | 448 B (Q, K, V, S, P) | 320 B (Q, K, V; K, V re-read once) | 0.71× |
| HBM writes | 320 B (S, P, O) | 64 B (only O) | 0.20× |
| **Total HBM traffic** | **768 B** | **384 B** | **0.50×** |
| FLOPs | 1,152 | 1,152 | 1.00× |
| Intermediate S+P in HBM | 256 B | 0 B | 0.00× |

Standard attention spends 67% of its HBM bytes moving the N×N intermediates S and P. FlashAttention eliminates all of that. The FLOPs are identical — *no compute is saved*. The speedup is entirely from bytes not moved.

This ratio gets dramatically better at production scale. At `N = 131,072` (Llama-3-70B long context), one attention head's S matrix alone is 32 GB. Standard attention writes and reads that 32 GB twice per forward pass. FlashAttention never materializes it. Across 64 heads and 80 layers, the savings compound to several TB of avoided HBM traffic per forward pass.

### 10.6: I/O complexity analysis

Now the quantitative gain. How many bytes does standard attention move, and how many does FlashAttention move?

**Standard attention**:

* Read Q, K, V once: `3 · N · d · 2 bytes`
* Write scores, read scores, write weights, read weights: `4 · N² · 2 bytes` (all over HBM)
* Write output: `N · d · 2 bytes`
* Total: roughly `8 N² + 8 N·d` bytes of HBM traffic.

The dominant term is `8 N²`, the repeated read/write of the N×N matrix.

**FlashAttention**:

* Read Q, K, V: `3 · N · d · 2 bytes` (each full matrix once)
* The N×N matrix never touches HBM.
* Write output: `N · d · 2 bytes`
* However, some secondary traffic: when we do `Q_block_count × K_block_count` tiles, each K/V block is re-read for every Q block. Total K/V re-reads: `Q_block_count · K · 2`.
* Total: approximately `N·d + (N²·d²) / M` bytes, where M is SRAM size.

For typical block sizes (`B_r = 128`, `B_c = 64`), the Q block count is `N / 128`, and for each Q block we read the full K (N rows). Total K-reads: `N · N = N²` rows, each row of size `d · 2`. That is `2 N² d` bytes, larger than `N²` alone.

At first glance this seems worse, not better. The trick is that **the reads are bandwidth-friendly sequential reads** (loading a K block is a contiguous transfer), and they hit in the L2 cache for multiple iterations, so effective HBM traffic is much lower.

![Figure 10.8: HBM I/O complexity: standard vs FlashAttention](figures/ch10-fig8-io-complexity-comparison/final.png)
*Figure 10.8.* A log-log line chart. X-axis: sequence length N from 256 to 32,000. Y-axis: HBM bytes transferred per attention layer (log scale). Two curves: standard attention O(N² + N·d) grows quadratically; FlashAttention O(N·d + N²·d²/M) grows nearly linearly for typical M. At N = 32,000, FlashAttention transfers ~10× less HBM than standard attention.

Figure 10.8 compares the two. In practice, the crossover happens around N = 1000 on H100, and by N = 32K the ratio is roughly 10×. For prefill on long contexts, this is a significant wall-clock speedup. For decode, the attention kernel dominates a smaller fraction of total time (projections and FFN are the larger costs), so the end-to-end gain is smaller, but still 1.5-2×.

### 10.7: The evolution: FA-1, FA-2, FA-3

FlashAttention has been revised three times as hardware evolved. Each version extracted more of the peak FLOPS by using GPU features the previous version did not.

![Figure 10.9: FlashAttention evolution: FA-1 → FA-2 → FA-3](figures/ch10-fig9-fa1-vs-fa2-vs-fa3/final.png)
*Figure 10.9.* Three vertical columns. FA-1 (2022): first tiling + online softmax; outer loop over K/V, inner over Q. FA-2 (2023): swapped outer/inner so outer is over Q (parallelizable across warps), halving redundant work. FA-3 (2024): Hopper-specific, asynchronous memory copies via TMA, producer/consumer warp patterns, FP8 support. A summary row at the bottom showing peak H100 utilization: FA-1 ~40%, FA-2 ~65%, FA-3 ~85%.

Figure 10.9 traces the evolution.

**FlashAttention-1 (2022, Dao et al.)** introduced the core tiling + online softmax idea. Its outer loop iterated over K/V blocks (sharing them across all queries), with the inner loop over Q blocks. This was good for training on A100s but left some parallelism unused during decode because different queries had to wait for each other.

**FlashAttention-2 (2023)** swapped the loop order. Outer loop over Q blocks, inner over K/V. This meant each Q block could be independently parallelized across warps in the SM. The result: much better utilization of the SM, and a roughly 2× speedup over FA-1 on training.

**FlashAttention-3 (2024)** added Hopper-specific features:

* **Async memory copies (TMA)**: Hopper's Tensor Memory Accelerator can issue HBM-to-SRAM copies asynchronously, overlapping with compute. FA-3 uses this to pipeline weight-loading with ongoing attention computation.
* **Producer/consumer warps**: some warps are dedicated to loading data, others to computing. This separation exploits Hopper's warp-specialized capabilities.
* **FP8 support**: the matmul step of attention can run on FP8 tensor cores (1,979 TFLOPS on H100), with accumulation in FP16 for stability.

The result: FlashAttention-3 reaches roughly 85% of H100's peak FP16 tensor core throughput on attention kernels, versus FA-2's ~65%. This is a substantial production win, a 1.3× speedup over FA-2 on the same hardware, just by using hardware features better.

![Figure 10.9.A: Three generations, one core algorithm](figures/ch10-fig12-fa-2-3-evolution/final.png)
*Figure 10.9.A.* Four-column evolution diagram. Column 1 "FA-1 (2022)": tiling + online softmax, outer loop over K/V inner over Q, ~40% H100 peak. Column 2 "FA-2 (2023)": swapped loop order, better warp parallelism, ~2× over FA-1, ~65% peak. Column 3 "FA-3 (2024)": async memory via TMA, producer/consumer warps, FP8 support, ~85% peak. Column 4: a vertical bar chart of utilization — FA-1 40%, FA-2 65%, FA-3 85%. Annotation: "Each revision exploits newer hardware features without changing the core tiling + online softmax idea."

For inference engineers: the specific version matters less than using *some* FlashAttention implementation. vLLM, SGLang, TensorRT-LLM, and Hugging Face TGI all use FA-2 or FA-3 internally. If you are not using FlashAttention, you are leaving ~2-3× on the table, and your operating point is deeper in memory-bound territory than it needs to be.

## FlashAttention on the Roofline

### 10.8: Where this places the attention kernel on the roofline

Recall from Chapter 7 that the attention kernel itself has arithmetic intensity approximately N (for decode), it does `N·d` FLOPs per query with bytes of similar order. This put attention specifically in a middle regime: not as deep in memory-bound territory as the weight-loading term, but still below the ridge for typical N.

FlashAttention eliminates the N×N intermediate tensors from HBM traffic. That changes the byte count dramatically, the attention kernel's bytes drop by roughly a factor of N/M (where M is the SRAM size). Arithmetic intensity rises correspondingly.

![Figure 10.10: Where FlashAttention moves you on the roofline](figures/ch10-fig10-flash-on-roofline/final.png)
*Figure 10.10.* The roofline diagram. Two labeled points: "Standard attention decode" in the deep memory-bound region (low AI). "FlashAttention decode" to the right and closer to the ridge (higher AI). A single clean arrow from the first to the second labeled: "FlashAttention shifts right → higher AI → closer to compute-bound." Legend: "FlashAttention reduces HBM bytes without reducing FLOPs."

Figure 10.10 shows the movement. Attention under standard implementation sits deep in memory-bound. Under FlashAttention, it moves right, arithmetic intensity rises by roughly 10× for typical long contexts. For the attention kernel specifically, this often pushes the operating point past the ridge into compute-bound territory.

Important caveat: FlashAttention only speeds up the *attention kernel*. The decode loop as a whole also does weight-loading (projections, FFN) which dominate decode time for most model sizes. FlashAttention does not help those; only attention itself. The end-to-end speedup from FlashAttention is therefore smaller than the attention-only speedup, and depends on what fraction of your decode time is actually attention versus projections + FFN.

For typical transformer inference:

* On small models (7B-13B) at short context (~4K), attention is ~15-25% of decode time. FlashAttention gives a modest 5-10% end-to-end speedup.
* On larger models (70B+) at long context (32K+), attention is 30-50% of decode time. FlashAttention gives a 15-25% end-to-end speedup.
* On training, FlashAttention's gains are larger still because attention dominates training compute time at long contexts.

### 10.9: FlashAttention and the other techniques

FlashAttention composes with head compression (Chapter 8) and token compression (Chapter 9). GQA with FlashAttention is the production default. MLA with FlashAttention is how DeepSeek-V3 serves efficiently. FlashAttention on sliding-window attention is how Mistral serves.

FlashAttention also composes with PagedAttention (Chapter 11), which is how vLLM's attention kernel works. The paged-attention kernel applies the FlashAttention tiling strategy, but the "K block" is actually a concatenation of page-addressed KV entries rather than a contiguous slab of HBM. This is additive, you get both the memory-layout benefit of PagedAttention and the HBM-traffic benefit of FlashAttention.

### 10.10: What FlashAttention does not solve

Three things.

**First, the KV cache size.** FlashAttention does not shrink the cache; it shrinks the *intermediate computation traffic*. You still need to read the K cache and V cache every decode step. Compression techniques from Chapters 8 and 9 are still needed.

**Second, the weight-loading cost.** Per-step, the dominant byte cost is reading the model weights (140 GB for Llama-3-70B). FlashAttention does not help this. Quantization (Chapter 13) does.

**Third, the scheduling.** FlashAttention speeds up one forward pass. It does not address how forward passes are scheduled across users or how long prefills stall decodes. That is the domain of PagedAttention + continuous batching + chunked prefill, covered in the next two chapters.

### 10.11: Where we go next

Chapter 11 is the second major memory-layout technique: **PagedAttention**. If FlashAttention is about rearranging the computation inside a forward pass, PagedAttention is about rearranging the cache layout across users. The two combine to make modern serving possible. Without PagedAttention, continuous batching falls apart; without FlashAttention, attention stays memory-bound even inside the pages.

# Chapter 11: PagedAttention

Chapter 10 rearranged the computation inside the attention kernel to avoid unnecessary HBM traffic. PagedAttention attacks a different problem: how the KV cache is **laid out in HBM across users**, and what that layout does to concurrent-user capacity.

The problem is easy to state. If you allocate a contiguous block of HBM for each user's KV cache up front, you have to choose how big to make the block, and you cannot know in advance how long the user's conversation will be. Allocate too much, you waste HBM and cannot admit more users. Allocate too little, the user runs out of room mid-conversation and you have to abort. Allocate a medium amount, you still waste a lot because some users write 50 tokens and stop while others write 20,000. This is the **fragmentation problem**, and in a traditional contiguous-allocation serving stack it forces engineers to over-allocate defensively, leaving 40-70% of HBM unused.

PagedAttention solves this by borrowing one of the oldest ideas in operating systems: **virtual memory**. Break each user's KV cache into small fixed-size blocks. Allow those blocks to live non-contiguously in HBM. Maintain a per-user "page table" that maps logical token positions to physical block addresses. When an attention kernel needs to read a past token's K or V, it consults the page table to find where that token's block actually lives.

The result, introduced by vLLM in 2023, was transformative. Production serving engines went from serving 4-8 concurrent users per GPU to serving 20-40. The GPU was not faster, it was just more fully utilized. This chapter walks through exactly how PagedAttention achieves that, from the fragmentation problem to the block table mechanics to the kernel that runs on top.

---

## The Fragmentation Problem

### 11.1: Contiguous KV cache: the default and its cost

If you wrote a naive serving stack, you would allocate each user's KV cache as a contiguous block of HBM, sized for the maximum expected conversation length. This is what PyTorch's stock attention does; it is what the original Huggingface Transformers library did; it is what most pre-vLLM serving stacks did.

![Figure 11.1: The fragmentation problem with contiguous allocation](figures/ch11-fig1-fragmentation-problem/final.png)
*Figure 11.1.* A horizontal strip of HBM (100 GB total) subdivided into four contiguous colored blocks, each pre-allocated to one user at max sequence length (25 GB each). Labels on each block indicate the actual usage: User A uses 2% of allocation, User B uses 93%, User C uses 25%, User D uses 5%. Annotation underneath: "Total HBM reserved: 100 GB. Actually used: 22 GB. Wasted: 78 GB."

Figure 11.1 shows the waste. The engine has allocated 25 GB per user, but real conversations have wildly varying lengths. User B, a long-form writer, fills 93% of their allocation. User A sent two messages and stopped; 2% used. The GPU is holding on to 100 GB of reserved cache space to serve four users, 78 GB of which is idle and locked up. A fifth user who arrives is refused, not because the HBM is actually full, but because every slot is pre-reserved.

This is **external fragmentation**. The total free HBM is enough to serve many more users, but it is partitioned into holes that cannot be used by anyone. Internal fragmentation (wasted space within an allocation) is a similar but distinct problem, you allocate 25 GB and use 12 GB, leaving 13 GB wasted within the block.

Contiguous allocation makes both fragmentation modes unavoidable. Either you pre-allocate (waste) or you allow cache to grow as needed (then you have to move it around when it outgrows its initial slot, which is expensive). No contiguous-allocation scheme avoids the waste.

### 11.2: Virtual memory: the idea from 1961

Computer systems solved a very similar problem sixty years ago. Operating systems needed to give each process the illusion of a large contiguous address space, while actually storing its data in scattered fragments of physical RAM. The solution was **virtual memory with page tables**, each process has a "virtual" address space, divided into fixed-size pages, and the OS maintains a per-process mapping from virtual pages to physical RAM pages. Physical pages can live anywhere. The hardware (MMU) translates virtual addresses to physical addresses on every memory access.

![Figure 11.2: Virtual memory (1961): the idea PagedAttention borrows](figures/ch11-fig2-virtual-memory-analogy/final.png)
*Figure 11.2.* Two panels side by side. Left: "OS virtual memory." A virtual address space rectangle at top (logical); a page table box in the middle; a physical RAM rectangle at the bottom, fragmented. Arrows show virtual-address to physical-page mapping via the table. Right: "PagedAttention (2023)." Same three-tier structure, retitled: logical sequence of tokens at top, block table in the middle, physical KV blocks in HBM at the bottom. Arrows show logical-token to physical-block mapping. Annotation: "Same indirection trick, 60 years apart."

Figure 11.2 puts the two side by side. PagedAttention is structurally identical. Each user has a "logical" KV cache indexed by token position 0, 1, 2, 3, ... These positions are translated through a block table into physical HBM block IDs. Physical blocks can be anywhere in HBM, in any order.

The attention kernel, when it reads token i's K and V, consults the block table, fetches the physical block containing token i, and reads the K and V from it. A few extra microseconds for the indirection; orders of magnitude more users fit per GPU.

## How PagedAttention Works

### 11.3: Contiguous vs paged, in one picture

![Figure 11.3: Contiguous vs paged KV cache allocation](figures/ch11-fig3-before-vs-after-allocation/final.png)
*Figure 11.3.* A side-by-side comparison. Left: "Contiguous" shows four large pre-reserved color blocks with visible white gaps between them (external fragmentation). Right: "Paged (vLLM)" shows the same HBM strip divided into ~40 small uniform blocks colored by user ownership (four colors interleaved), with no wasted gaps. A separate block-table panel shows per-user mappings: "User A → blocks [3, 11, 27]", etc. Annotation under both panels: "Utilization jumps from ~40% to >96%."

Figure 11.3 is the transformation. Instead of four large slabs, HBM is now subdivided into roughly 40 small uniform blocks (typically 16-token blocks, with each block's size being `16 tokens × H · D · 2 bytes × 2 (K,V) × L layers`, for Llama-3-70B at GQA with H\_kv=8, D=128, that is `16 × 8 × 128 × 2 × 2 × 80 = 6.5 MB per block`). Each block is assigned to exactly one user at any given time.

A user's logical sequence maps through the block table to whichever physical blocks they currently hold. If user A has 48 tokens of context, they hold 3 blocks (48/16). Those blocks do not need to be contiguous, block 3, block 11, block 27 is perfectly fine. The attention kernel follows the block table to find them.

When a user's session ends, their blocks are immediately returned to the free pool. When a new user arrives, they request blocks from the pool and the system hands over whichever blocks are free. No fragmentation. No pre-reservation.

### 11.4: The block table: how address translation works

Each user has a small per-session data structure called the **block table**. Concretely, it is a short list of physical block IDs:

```
User A's block table = [7, 23, 2]
```

That means: user A's logical tokens 0-15 live in physical block 7, tokens 16-31 live in physical block 23, tokens 32-47 live in physical block 2.

![Figure 11.4: Block table: address translation](figures/ch11-fig4-block-table-translation/final.png)
*Figure 11.4.* A three-stage vertical flow. Stage 1: a user's token sequence 0-11 as small boxes. Stage 2: "Block table for User A" showing 3 rows: logical block index 0 → physical block 7; 1 → block 12; 2 → block 91. Arrows group the tokens into logical blocks and map to physical blocks. Stage 3: an HBM region with ~100 small blocks; blocks 7, 12, 91 are highlighted as "User A's storage." Annotation: "Two layers of indirection. That's it."

Figure 11.4 shows the full translation. To access token 11 of user A:

1. Compute `logical_block = 11 // 16 = 0` (block 0) and `offset = 11 % 16 = 11`.
2. Look up physical block: `block_table[0] = 7`.
3. Access HBM block 7 at offset 11.

Two integer divisions and one table lookup. At production scale, this overhead is a few tens of nanoseconds per access, small compared to the HBM latency of hundreds of cycles.

### 11.5: On-demand allocation

Blocks are allocated only as needed. When a user's conversation grows past the current block's capacity, a new block is requested from the free pool.

![Figure 11.5: Blocks allocated on demand as the sequence grows](figures/ch11-fig5-allocation-timeline/final.png)
*Figure 11.5.* A horizontal timeline with four snapshots of one user's block table. Snapshot 1 (t=0): 0 tokens, empty block table, 50 green free blocks in HBM. Snapshot 2 (t=1): 4 tokens, block table = [7]; one HBM block flipped from green to lavender. Snapshot 3 (t=2): 9 tokens, block table = [7, 23]; two blocks lavender (non-contiguous). Snapshot 4 (t=3): 13 tokens, block table = [7, 23, 2]; three blocks lavender.

Figure 11.5 shows the lifecycle. As the user's conversation grows from 0 to 13 tokens, blocks are pulled from the free pool only when the previous block fills. Crucially, **the blocks need not be contiguous in HBM**, block 7, then 23, then 2. The block table tracks where everything is.

If the user's conversation ends at 9 tokens, only 2 blocks were used. The third block was never allocated. When the user's session ends, blocks 7 and 23 return to the free pool for the next user. No fragmentation.

### 11.6: The PagedAttention kernel

The attention kernel has to handle the indirection. Instead of reading a contiguous K cache, it has to read from scattered physical blocks.

![Figure 11.6: The PagedAttention kernel: following the block table](figures/ch11-fig6-paged-attention-kernel/final.png)
*Figure 11.6.* A central block table with three physical block IDs (7, 23, 2). Below, three HBM blocks drawn with K/V vectors inside: block 7 (tokens 0-3), block 23 (tokens 4-7), block 2 (tokens 8-11). Above the block table, a single query vector Q. Three arrows flow from Q to each of the three blocks (non-contiguous gather), each labeled "Q · K\_block^T → partial scores." The three partial-score outputs flow into an "Online softmax accumulator" box that produces the final output.

Figure 11.6 shows the kernel structure. For a decode step on user A:

1. The kernel receives the user's block table and the new query vector Q.
2. For each physical block listed in the block table:
   - Fetch the block into SRAM.
   - Compute partial attention scores: `Q · K_block^T / √d`.
   - Apply the online softmax update rule (from Chapter 10).
   - Accumulate the partial output via the exponential rescaling.
3. After all blocks have been processed, the accumulated output is the final context vector.

The online softmax from Chapter 10 transfers perfectly. Each block contributes to the running max, sum, and output. The fact that the blocks are non-contiguous in HBM does not affect the math, the tile-by-tile computation is identical in structure.

![Figure 11.7: Online softmax across non-contiguous blocks](figures/ch11-fig7-online-softmax-across-blocks/final.png)
*Figure 11.7.* Three vertical steps. Step 1: fetch block 7, compute Q · K\_7^T, get m\_1, l\_1, o\_1. Step 2: fetch block 23, compute Q · K\_23^T, get m\_2, l\_2, o\_2. Merge via online-softmax: m\_new = max(m\_1, m\_2), rescale and add. Step 3: fetch block 2, same merge. Final state is the exact attention output.

Figure 11.7 illustrates the merge. Each non-contiguous block contributes to the running softmax state. Order matters slightly for numerical stability (processing the blocks roughly in order of decreasing value magnitude gives slightly better precision) but not for correctness.

### 11.7: Prefix sharing: an unexpected bonus

PagedAttention enables a bonus optimization: when multiple users share the same prompt prefix (system message, conversation template, etc.), they can **share the physical blocks** that hold the K/V of that prefix.

![Figure 11.8: Prefix sharing with copy-on-write](figures/ch11-fig8-prefix-sharing-cow/final.png)
*Figure 11.8.* Three users (A, B, C) all started with the same 64-token system prompt. The shared prefix occupies 4 KV blocks (5, 6, 7, 8) with a "refcount = 3" label. Each user's block table shows the shared prefix plus their own private continuation: User A → [5, 6, 7, 8, 42, 43]; User B → [5, 6, 7, 8, 19]; User C → [5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13]. Annotation: "64 tokens of shared prefix stored ONCE, referenced by three users." A separate callout: "Copy-on-write: if a user tries to modify a shared block, it is cloned first so others keep the original."

Figure 11.8 shows prefix sharing at work. Three users, all with the same system prompt, point to the same four physical blocks for the shared prefix. The KV for those 64 prefix tokens is computed exactly once (by the first user's prefill) and reused by the next two. A **reference count** tracks how many users depend on a given block; the block is freed only when the refcount drops to zero.

When a user wants to modify a shared block (e.g., they start generating new tokens on top of the shared prefix), the block is copied first so the other users' view is not disturbed. This is **copy-on-write**, borrowed directly from OS virtual memory. In practice, generation always creates *new* blocks at the end of a sequence, so COW is rarely triggered, most sharing is read-only.

Prefix sharing is the foundation of **prefix caching**, which we cover in Chapter 12. Think of Chapter 12 as taking this bonus and turning it into a systematic optimization across sessions.

### 11.8: What this does to utilization

Figure 11.9 quantifies the end-to-end impact.

![Figure 11.9: KV cache utilization: before vs after paged attention](figures/ch11-fig9-utilization-before-after/final.png)
*Figure 11.9.* Two bar groups. Group 1 "Without PagedAttention": model weights 40 GB + reserved KV cache 60 GB (mostly empty); 3-5 concurrent users fit. Group 2 "With PagedAttention": model weights 40 GB + packed KV cache 40 GB (densely packed, ~96% filled) + 20 GB working headroom; 20-40 concurrent users fit. Annotation: "~8× more concurrent users fit in the same GPU."

Figure 11.9 is the production impact. Without PagedAttention, a typical deployment on a single H100 for Llama-3-70B could serve 3-5 concurrent users. With PagedAttention, the same hardware serves 20-40 users, an 8× improvement, without any change in per-request quality or latency.

This is the largest single-hardware improvement in inference history. It was the thing that made vLLM ~10× cheaper per token than Hugging Face Transformers for most workloads when it launched in 2023, and it remains the foundation of why vLLM is the default serving engine in 2026.

### 11.9: PagedAttention on the roofline

![Figure 11.10: How PagedAttention pushes you up the roofline](figures/ch11-fig10-paged-on-roofline/final.png)
*Figure 11.10.* The roofline diagram. Two labeled points: "Contiguous batching (few users)" low on the slope; "Paged + continuous batching (many users)" higher on the slope, closer to the ridge. A clean arrow from the first to the second, labeled "More concurrent users → more tokens per HBM weight-load → higher AI." Legend card: "Bigger effective batch is the secret."

Figure 11.10 is the roofline interpretation. PagedAttention does not directly reduce bytes per token, a user's cache still has to be read every step. What it does is **allow many more concurrent users**, which means each HBM weight-load is amortized across more decode tokens. Arithmetic intensity rises multiplicatively with effective batch size. The decode operating point climbs the slope.

This is why PagedAttention and continuous batching (Chapter 14) are always discussed together. One enables the other. Continuous batching needs PagedAttention because without non-contiguous cache, sessions joining and leaving the batch would immediately create fragmentation. PagedAttention needs continuous batching to realize its benefits, because its whole point is to let more users run simultaneously.

---

## What PagedAttention Does Not Solve

### 11.10: The remaining problems

PagedAttention attacks memory layout. It does not attack:

* **Per-token cache bytes.** A user's cache is the same size paged or unpaged; PagedAttention just doesn't waste HBM around it. To reduce per-token cache bytes, you still need head/token compression (Chapters 8-9) or quantization (Chapter 13).
* **Weight-loading cost.** Per decode step still reads the full model weights from HBM. PagedAttention does nothing for this.
* **Prefill/decode scheduling conflicts.** A long prefill still stalls ongoing decodes unless you add chunked prefill (Chapter 12).
* **Prefix recomputation across sessions.** Two sessions sharing a prefix in Figure 11.8 do share the KV cache at runtime, but if the second session arrives *after* the first has finished, the prefix must be recomputed. Prefix caching across sessions requires persistent storage of the KV blocks plus a hash-based lookup, which is Chapter 12.

### 11.11: Block size: the one knob

The main tuning knob in PagedAttention is block size, how many tokens fit in one physical block. Small block size (4-8 tokens) gives finer granularity and less internal fragmentation within blocks, but more per-step overhead (more block lookups per attention step). Large block size (32-64 tokens) reduces lookup overhead but increases internal fragmentation for users whose sequences are not multiples of the block size.

vLLM's default is 16 tokens per block, which is a good compromise for most workloads. On very short sequences (voice streaming, short chat) a smaller block size can help. On very long sequences (document processing), larger blocks reduce overhead.

### 11.12: Where we go next

Chapter 12 extends PagedAttention's prefix-sharing insight into a full-featured **prefix caching + chunked prefill** system. We will see how to persist KV blocks across user sessions, how to hash-match prefixes across different users and requests, and how to break long prefills into smaller pieces so they do not stall the decode queue. Together with PagedAttention and FlashAttention, these complete the modern serving engine's memory and scheduling story.

# Chapter 12: Prefix Caching and Chunked Prefill

Two optimizations in one chapter. Both attack a specific pathology of modern LLM serving. Both are almost universally enabled in production stacks in 2026. Both are conceptually simple but have deep consequences for how serving engines schedule work.

**Prefix caching** addresses this: thousands of users hitting an LLM endpoint often start with the same (or very similar) prompt prefix, a system message, a conversation template, a few-shot example set. Without any optimization, every user's prefill runs from scratch, recomputing K and V for the exact same prefix tokens over and over. With prefix caching, the engine hashes the prefix, stores the K/V blocks of prefixes it has seen before, and reuses them across users.

**Chunked prefill** addresses this: a new user arriving with a 16,000-token prompt causes a single compute-heavy forward pass that stalls *every other user's decode* for hundreds of milliseconds. The P99 ITL spike is severe. Chunked prefill breaks the long prefill into smaller slices that are interleaved with ongoing decodes, so no single user's prefill can hold the GPU hostage.

Together, these two techniques are what turn an engine from "works for one user at a time" into "works for many simultaneous users with stable P99." Every production serving engine in 2026, vLLM, SGLang, TensorRT-LLM, TGI, implements both, because without them the P99 latency story falls apart at any meaningful traffic.

## Two Production Pains

### 12.1: The redundant-prefix pain

Picture a chat product. Every request begins with a 500-token system prompt defining the assistant's behavior. Each of 10,000 concurrent users, on each of their 30 messages, sends this same 500-token prefix. That is 150 million redundant prefix-token prefills per day.

Prefill cost scales quadratically with prefix length (Chapter 5). For 500 tokens at Llama-3-70B on H100, one prefill is about 45 milliseconds. 150 million of those per day is 1,875 GPU-hours per day just for prefix computation that is identical across users.

![Figure 12.1: Two queries sharing a prefix](figures/ch12-fig1-shared-prefix-visual/final.png)
*Figure 12.1.* Two horizontal token rows. Query A: "You are a helpful assistant. Use concise answers. Explain quicksort." Query B: "You are a helpful assistant. Use concise answers. Write a haiku about rain." A big bracket spans the identical first 48 tokens of both queries labeled "IDENTICAL PREFIX, 48 tokens." Annotation: "The K and V for these 48 tokens are the same, regardless of what follows."

Figure 12.1 shows the redundancy. The first 48 tokens of both queries produce identical K and V vectors, because K and V are deterministic functions of the input token embeddings and the frozen weight matrices. If we cached the K and V of the first query, we could reuse them for the second query's first 48 tokens, skipping prefill for those tokens entirely.

This is what prefix caching does. The mechanism is exactly what the hash-indexed PagedAttention block pool (Chapter 11) was built to support, plus a per-prefix hash lookup to find previously-computed blocks.

### 12.2: The head-of-line-blocking pain

Separately from prefix redundancy, production stacks hit another problem: prefill and decode compete for the same GPU.

![Figure 12.2: Head-of-line blocking: a long prefill stalls all decodes](figures/ch12-fig4-head-of-line-blocking/final.png)
*Figure 12.2.* A two-lane horizontal timeline. Top lane: User A decoding tokens every ~50 ms, steady until t=400 ms, then a big gap for 800 ms with no tokens, then resumes. Bottom lane: User B just arrived with a 4000-token prompt at t=400 ms; a long solid block from t=400 to t=1200 ms labeled "prefill in progress (800 ms)." Annotation between the lanes: "User A's ITL spikes from 50 ms to 850 ms."

Figure 12.2 shows the pathology. User A is happily decoding, one token every 50 ms. At t = 400 ms, a new user B arrives with a 4000-token prompt. The GPU pauses A's decode for 800 ms to run B's prefill. A then resumes. On the dashboard, A's ITL for that one step was 850 ms, a 17× spike over normal. P99 ITL for the serving window just broke SLO.

This is **head-of-line blocking**. It is not a small effect, in any mixed-workload production system, you will see these spikes unless you do something to prevent them. The fix is to break long prefills into smaller chunks that can be interleaved with decodes.

## The Two Techniques in Detail

### 12.3: Prefix caching: the lifecycle

Prefix caching adds three things to a PagedAttention-based engine:

1. **A hash function.** Maps a token sequence (the prefix) to a hash value.
2. **A hash-indexed lookup table.** Maps prefix hashes to block-table pointers.
3. **Reference counting.** Tracks how many active users depend on each cached prefix's blocks, so we know when to evict.

![Figure 12.3: Lifecycle of a prefix cache hit](figures/ch12-fig2-prefix-cache-hit-lifecycle/final.png)
*Figure 12.3.* A horizontal flow of five boxes. (1) "New request with prompt tokens [t1 t2 ... t50]." (2) "Compute prefix hashes: hash(t[:16]) → hash\_a, hash(t[:32]) → hash\_b, hash(t[:48]) → hash\_c." (3) "Look up cache: hash\_c FOUND! (48 tokens already cached)." (4) "Skip recomputing K, V for tokens 1-48. Only prefill tokens 49-50." (5) "Result: TTFT drops from 400 ms to 50 ms." A small legend underneath: "Cache key = hash of the token sequence. Cache value = pointer to the physical KV blocks."

Figure 12.3 shows the per-request flow. When a new request arrives, the engine hashes prefixes of increasing lengths (in block-aligned multiples). It looks up each hash in the cache; the longest one that hits is the best match. The engine then reuses the cached blocks for that prefix and only runs prefill on the remaining tokens.

The hash function is typically xxhash or similar, fast, cryptographically weak but collision-resistant enough for a cache. The key is the full sequence of token IDs (not just a prefix string), so two semantically identical prompts expressed with different tokenizations would miss, but this is fine in practice because tokenization is deterministic.

### 12.4: Reference counting and hash-indexed blocks

![Figure 12.4: Reference counting and hash table for prefix cache](figures/ch12-fig3-refcount-hashtable/final.png)
*Figure 12.4.* A central hash table box with 3 entries, each mapping a hash to (block\_ids, refcount): "hash\_sys\_prompt → blocks [5, 6, 7, 8] refcount: 12." "hash\_tool\_prefix → [42, 43] refcount: 3." "hash\_user\_greeting → [101] refcount: 1." Left side: three incoming users, each mapping to entries they hit. Right side: "Eviction rule: when refcount → 0, blocks return to free pool (LRU among zero-refcount entries)."

Figure 12.4 shows the data structure. Each entry in the prefix cache table has three fields: the hash (key), the list of physical block IDs where that prefix's KV lives, and a reference count of how many active sessions are currently using this prefix.

When a new session arrives and hits a cached prefix, the refcount goes up. When that session ends, the refcount goes down. A refcount of zero means no active session needs this cache entry, so it becomes a candidate for eviction. When the GPU runs out of free blocks, the engine evicts zero-refcount entries in LRU order (least recently used).

This is a classic caching design. The production engineering is getting the eviction policy right: under high memory pressure, do you evict popular prefixes (hurts average hit rate) or rare prefixes (might be causing the pressure)? vLLM's default is LRU, which works well because shared prefixes (system prompts) tend to be reused constantly and therefore stay "recent."

### 12.5: Chunked prefill: interleaving prefill with decode

Now the other pain. Figure 12.5 shows the fix for head-of-line blocking.

![Figure 12.5: Chunked prefill: interleave prefill chunks with ongoing decodes](figures/ch12-fig5-chunked-prefill-timeline/final.png)
*Figure 12.5.* Same two-lane layout as Figure 12.2, but now the bottom lane's prefill is chunked. Top lane: User A decoding tokens steadily, ~50 ms each, NO gap. Bottom lane: User B's 4000-token prefill is broken into eight chunks of 512 tokens each, drawn as separate small blocks at evenly spaced intervals, interleaved with User A's decode tokens. Annotation: "User B's prefill broken into 8 chunks of 512. Each chunk processed between decode steps. User A barely notices."

Figure 12.5 is chunked prefill at work. Instead of running user B's full 4000-token prefill as one monolithic forward pass, the engine breaks it into 8 chunks of 512 tokens. Each chunk is processed in its own forward pass, sharing the GPU with ongoing decodes. The decode loop for user A continues at ~50 ms per step; user B's prefill completes across 8 steps rather than 1, but the total latency is similar and no other user is stalled.

### 12.6: The chunk size trade-off

Choosing the chunk size is the one tuning decision for chunked prefill. Larger chunks mean faster per-request prefill (closer to native TTFT) but more decode stall per chunk. Smaller chunks mean smoother decodes but slower prefills.

![Figure 12.6: Chunk size trade-off](figures/ch12-fig6-chunk-size-tradeoff/final.png)
*Figure 12.6.* A line chart. X-axis: chunk size (tokens) from 64 to 4096 (log). Two curves: "TTFT (ms)" descending (bigger chunks → faster prefill → better TTFT); "Decode ITL jitter (ms)" ascending (bigger chunks → more decode stalls). A shaded "sweet spot" region around 512-1024 tokens. Annotation: "Production default: 512 tokens per chunk."

Figure 12.6 shows the trade-off. The sweet spot for typical H100 deployments is 512 to 1024 tokens per chunk. At 512, the per-chunk compute takes about 10-20 ms, small enough that decodes barely notice, large enough that prefill throughput is acceptable. At 2048+, decodes feel the chunks; at 128, prefill latency grows too much.

vLLM exposes this as `max_num_batched_tokens` (default 8192 in v1), which combined with `long_prefill_token_threshold` (default 2048) defines the chunking behavior. If a request's prompt exceeds the threshold, it is automatically chunked.

### 12.7: Chunked prefill + FlashAttention: composition

Both chunked prefill and FlashAttention are tiling strategies. They operate at different levels of the stack.

![Figure 12.7: Chunked prefill + FlashAttention: two levels of tiling](figures/ch12-fig7-chunked-prefill-plus-flash/final.png)
*Figure 12.7.* Two nested rectangles. Outer "Chunked Prefill level": a 4096-token prompt divided into 8 chunks of 512 tokens each. Inner "FlashAttention level": one 512-token chunk further tiled into 8 tiles of 64 tokens for SRAM processing. A bracket between them: "Composition: 8 chunks × 8 SRAM tiles per chunk."

Figure 12.7 shows the composition. Chunked prefill operates at the scheduler level, deciding which chunk of which prefill goes into which forward pass. FlashAttention operates at the kernel level, deciding how the attention within one forward pass is tiled into SRAM. Both are tiling strategies, at different granularities.

They compose cleanly. Within each prefill chunk, the attention kernel uses FlashAttention to avoid materializing the chunk's N×N score matrix in HBM. Across chunks, the scheduler interleaves with decodes. The two techniques attack different bottlenecks and add up multiplicatively.

### 12.8: Chunked prefill + prefix caching: the full savings

And when a chunked prefill hits a prefix cache, the savings compound.

![Figure 12.8: Chunked prefill + prefix caching together](figures/ch12-fig8-chunked-plus-prefix-cache/final.png)
*Figure 12.8.* A walkthrough scenario. Step 1: "5000-token prompt arrives." Step 2: "First 3500 tokens match system-prompt cache." Step 3: "Only 1500 remaining tokens need prefill." Step 4: "Chunked into 3 chunks of 512." Step 5: "Each chunk processed between decodes, TTFT = 140 ms." A small savings summary: "Without optimizations: 800 ms TTFT. With prefix cache alone: 240 ms. With cache + chunked: stable 140 ms, no HOL blocking."

Figure 12.8 shows a realistic scenario. A user arrives with a 5000-token prompt where the first 3500 tokens are the system's prefix cache (system message + RAG context + conversation history). Prefix caching skips those 3500 tokens entirely, leaving only 1500 tokens of actual new prefill. Chunked prefill breaks those 1500 into 3 chunks of 512. The user's TTFT drops from a naive 800 ms to 140 ms, a 5.7× improvement, while also eliminating P99 ITL spikes for other users.

This is the production-serving reality for modern chat workloads. Every frontier API (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) implements some version of this. Every serious open-source serving engine does. The user-experience difference between enabled and disabled is enormous, not marginal.

### 12.9: The complete optimization stack

Let me step back and look at the stack.

![Figure 12.9: The complete prefill-side optimization stack](figures/ch12-fig9-optimization-stack/final.png)
*Figure 12.9.* Six horizontal layers stacked bottom to top. Layer 1 (biggest, bottom): "Attention math itself." Layer 2: "PagedAttention (removes fragmentation)." Layer 3: "Continuous batching (pack more users per forward pass)." Layer 4: "Chunked prefill (remove HOL blocking between prefill and decode)." Layer 5: "Prefix caching (skip recomputing shared prefixes)." Layer 6 (top): "FlashAttention (make each kernel call efficient)." Annotation: "Every layer above is multiplicative. Modern engines use ALL of these together."

Figure 12.9 shows why modern serving engines are what they are. Every optimization in this book stacks on top of the others. PagedAttention enables continuous batching. Continuous batching enables effective chunked prefill. Chunked prefill enables stable P99 ITL under mixed workloads. Prefix caching enables TTFT reductions on shared prefixes. FlashAttention makes each forward pass efficient regardless of where it comes from.

Disable any one layer and you degrade a specific metric. Disable PagedAttention and concurrent-user capacity collapses. Disable chunked prefill and P99 ITL spikes. Disable prefix caching and TTFT regresses on repeat-prefix workloads. Production serving is the sum of these, not any one.

### 12.10: The metrics impact

Figure 12.10 quantifies what these two optimizations do to production metrics.

![Figure 12.10: TTFT and ITL before and after chunked prefill + prefix cache](figures/ch12-fig10-metrics-impact/final.png)
*Figure 12.10.* A grouped bar chart. Two scenarios, before and after. Four bars per scenario: median TTFT (before 400 ms, after 80 ms); P99 TTFT (before 2200 ms, after 220 ms); median ITL (before 50 ms, after 48 ms); P99 ITL (before 850 ms, after 55 ms). Annotation: "P99 metrics improve by 10×, median barely changes (only the tail was broken)."

Figure 12.10 shows the real impact. Median TTFT drops 5× with prefix caching. P99 TTFT drops 10× because chunked prefill flattens the tail. Median ITL barely moves (it was already fine). P99 ITL drops 15× because the spikes from long-prefill contention disappear.

Notice the pattern: **medians improve modestly, P99 improves dramatically**. This is the production signature of scheduling-layer optimizations. If your deployment has fine medians but painful tails, it is almost always a scheduling problem, and chunked prefill + prefix caching is the usual fix.

---

## Where These Fit in the Roofline Story

### 12.11: Where prefix caching moves you

Prefix caching eliminates prefill compute for shared tokens. On the roofline, this moves the *prefill* operating point in a specific way: fewer tokens to prefill means the compute-bound region sees fewer bytes go through, so prefill time drops almost linearly in the cache-hit ratio. For workloads where 80% of prefill tokens are cached, prefill cost drops 5×.

Decode is unaffected. Prefix caching helps TTFT but not ITL.

### 12.12: Where chunked prefill moves you

Chunked prefill does not change the fundamental compute or memory usage, the total FLOPs and bytes are the same whether you chunk or not. What it changes is the **scheduling**. Decodes run alongside prefill chunks instead of behind them. The effective operating point for concurrent decodes is unchanged; what changes is that prefills no longer dominate any one forward pass.

On the roofline, you see this as a stabilization of the decode dot across time. Without chunked prefill, the decode dot moves up and down erratically as long prefills occupy the GPU; with it, the dot stays in place.

### 12.13: Where we go next

Chapter 13 addresses the third major memory lever in the book: **quantization**. Reducing the bits per parameter and per cache entry. This is additive with everything we have seen so far, it works inside PagedAttention blocks, benefits FlashAttention kernels, compresses prefix-cached prefixes too. Quantization is the technique that takes a stack already optimized via Chapters 7-12 and compresses the resulting cost by another 2-4×.

# Breadcrumb: The Cache Is Handled

You have now worked through Chapters 5 through 12. This is the deepest technical block of the book so far. Before we move on to quantization and the scheduling techniques that follow, let us mark what you have covered.

---

## The journey so far, in this block

**Chapter 5** derived the KV cache from first principles. You saw matrix by matrix what is wasted in naive inference (the first N-1 rows of Q, K, V recomputed every step), and exactly which rows are genuinely new per decode step. You walked through this on a toy with real numbers, "The next day is", that will remain the canonical example for the rest of the book.

**Chapter 6** gave you the GPU hardware underneath. Streaming multiprocessors, tensor cores, the memory hierarchy, NVLink and InfiniBand. Every future chapter's mental model of "compute" and "memory" lives in the picture Chapter 6 drew.

**Chapter 7** named the good and the evil of the KV cache. The good: O(N²) FLOPs collapse to O(N). The evil: bytes grow linearly with N, decoding becomes memory-bound, and 43 GB per user at 32K context on Llama-3-70B is the ceiling that limits concurrent users. Chapter 7 ended with a question: can we have the FLOP savings without the bandwidth cost?

**Chapter 8** answered half of that question by compressing across heads. MHA → MQA → GQA → MLA. Llama-3 uses GQA with G = 8. DeepSeek-V3 uses MLA. These are the variants in production today, with 4× to 64× per-token cache savings at minimal quality cost.

**Chapter 9** answered the other half by compressing across tokens. Sliding window caps the cache at a fixed W. Linear attention collapses past tokens into a D×D running state. SSMs and Mamba replace attention with a recurrence that has fixed-size hidden state. Each technique trades retrieval quality for memory savings in a different way, and production uses are rare outside hybrid architectures.

**Chapter 10** rearranged *how* the attention kernel uses memory. FlashAttention tiles the computation into SRAM so the N×N score matrix never touches HBM. FA-1 → FA-2 → FA-3 extracted progressively more peak utilization; FA-3 on H100 hits ~85% of tensor core peak.

**Chapter 11** rearranged *where* the KV cache lives in HBM. PagedAttention fragments the cache into 16-token blocks that can sit anywhere in HBM, tracked by a per-user block table. Concurrent-user capacity jumps 8× because nothing is over-allocated.

**Chapter 12** rearranged *when* and *how* prefill and decode share the GPU. Prefix caching reuses the K and V of shared prefixes across users. Chunked prefill interleaves long prefill chunks with ongoing decodes so no single user stalls the system. Both are enabled by the paged layout from Chapter 11.

---

## The big picture

You now understand the mechanisms that transform a naive transformer decode loop (O(N²) per step, 1% GPU utilization, 3 concurrent users per H100) into a modern production serving engine (O(N) per step, 60% GPU utilization, 20-40 concurrent users). Every piece of that transformation is one of the eight chapters above.

On the roofline, you have followed the decode operating point from:

* **Post-KV-cache (Chapter 7):** deep left, arithmetic intensity ~1.
* **Post-head-compression (Chapter 8):** slightly right, AI rises by ~8× (GQA) or ~64× (MLA).
* **Post-FlashAttention (Chapter 10):** the attention kernel alone moves far right (its AI rises by ~10×); end-to-end decode AI rises modestly.
* **Post-PagedAttention (Chapter 11):** up the slope as concurrent batch size grows.
* **Post-chunked-prefill (Chapter 12):** stabilized, the dot stops bouncing when long prefills arrive.

The operating point is no longer deep in memory-bound territory. For well-optimized decode at batch 32, it sits close to the ridge.

---

## What remains

There are three more big levers in the runtime layer, and they are Chapters 13-15.

**Chapter 13** is **quantization**: reducing bytes per weight, per activation, and per KV cache entry. FP16 to FP8 to INT4 to ternary. Each step down multiplies everything you have built in Chapters 5-12, less bandwidth pressure, higher compute ceiling on quantized tensor cores, more concurrent users per GPU.

**Chapter 14** is **continuous batching**, which you have actually been assuming all along. Chapter 14 makes it explicit, how sequences join and leave the active batch dynamically, why this requires PagedAttention, and how vLLM's scheduler makes the decision on every step.

**Chapter 15** is **speculative decoding**, a clever way to produce multiple tokens per forward pass by having a cheap "draft" model predict several tokens and a full model verify them. A 2-4× speedup at no quality loss, conditional on the draft model being good enough.

After that, Chapters 16-18 move to the infrastructure layer, parallelism, disaggregation, replication. Chapters 19-22 cover tooling, vLLM internals, the engine landscape, fine-tuning tie-ins. Chapter 23 tours the frontiers (multimodal, embodied). And Chapters 24-26 are the capstones.

---

## Where we go next

Chapter 13 is next. Quantization is the single biggest additional lever after the KV-cache techniques we just built. An optimized INT4-quantized Llama-3-70B on one H100 serves roughly 4× more tokens per dollar than the FP16 version on the same hardware. That is the subject.

# Chapter 13: Quantization

Chapters 8 through 12 attacked the KV cache and the memory-traffic patterns of attention. Chapter 13 attacks the third major byte consumer: **the weights themselves**. A 70B-parameter model at FP16 occupies 140 GB; at INT4 it occupies 35 GB. Same model, same quality after careful quantization, one-quarter the bytes. That reduction cascades through the roofline in two directions simultaneously, fewer bytes per forward pass (better for memory-bound decode) and access to higher tensor-core ceilings that exist specifically for lower-precision operations (better for compute-bound prefill).

Quantization is the rare optimization that wins in both regimes. It is also the most mathematically subtle technique in the runtime layer, because "make this number smaller with fewer bits" has many non-equivalent answers, symmetric vs asymmetric, per-channel vs per-tensor, post-training vs quantization-aware, and each choice trades quality differently. This chapter walks through the hierarchy: how floats are stored at the bit level, what the major numerical formats are, the two major paradigms (weight-only and W8A8), the specific production algorithms (GPTQ, AWQ, GGUF, QAT, BitNet), and the one idea that underlies all of them.

By the end you will know which quantization to pick for which workload, why DeepSeek-V3 trained in FP8 and produced a model that serves faster than any FP16 alternative, and how 1.58-bit quantization (BitNet) turns the matmul into pure additions. This is the final chapter in the cache-and-byte story; Chapter 14 turns to scheduling.

---

## Why Quantization Works at All

### 13.1: The core claim: most bits in a float are wasted

A floating-point number in FP32 occupies 32 bits. For most weights in a trained neural network, the range of values actually observed is much smaller than what FP32 can represent, typically `±1` or so, with values clustered tightly around zero. Using 32 bits to represent a number whose meaningful dynamic range is two orders of magnitude is mathematically extravagant.

If we could replace 32-bit floats with 8-bit (or 4-bit, or 2-bit) integers, we would move dramatically less data through the memory hierarchy per forward pass. The question is how much quality loss this imposes.

The empirical answer, worked out across hundreds of papers since 2020: **surprisingly little**, for most of a model. Weights can often be represented in 4 bits with less than 1% accuracy loss on standard benchmarks. Activations are more sensitive, outlier values in the residual stream drive precision requirements up, but even activations can usually run in 8 bits with careful calibration. The asymmetry (weights more compressible than activations) is why weight-only quantization is the most common production choice.

This chapter treats each of these choices carefully. Let us start with how floats are stored, because the compression mechanisms are all rooted in the bit-level structure.

---

## The Quantization Hierarchy

### 13.2: Floating-point representation: sign, exponent, mantissa

![Figure 13.1: How floating-point numbers are stored](figures/ch13-fig1-float32-bits/final.png)
*Figure 13.1.* A 32-bit strip representing FP32, color-coded into three segments. Bit 31 (1 bit): sign, 0 for positive, 1 for negative. Bits 30-23 (8 bits): exponent, selects the "window" (2^(e-127)). Bits 22-0 (23 bits): mantissa, fraction within the window. A worked example shows encoding 6.1: sign = 0, exponent = 129 (because 2^2 ≤ 6.1 < 2^3, bias 127+2), mantissa chosen to represent 6.1 within its window.

Figure 13.1 shows the IEEE 754 FP32 layout. Three segments encode three independent pieces of information:

* The **sign** bit flips the number positive or negative. One bit.
* The **exponent** (8 bits for FP32) selects a "window" of values. It is stored as an unsigned integer, then biased by -127. An exponent of 129 means the window is `2^(129-127) = 2^2 = 4`, i.e., the number lies between 4 and 8.
* The **mantissa** (23 bits for FP32) specifies where in that window. It encodes a fraction between 0 and 1, interpreted as the position within the current exponent's range.

The combination gives a wide dynamic range (roughly 10^-38 to 10^38) with about 7 decimal digits of precision. For most neural-network weights, which are tiny fractions between -1 and 1, this is vast overkill on the exponent dimension and modest over-precision on the mantissa.

### 13.3: The format zoo

Moving down the precision ladder, the available formats trade exponent bits, mantissa bits, or both.

![Figure 13.2: Floating-point / integer formats at a glance](figures/ch13-fig2-format-zoo/final.png)
*Figure 13.2.* Six horizontal bit strips, each labeled with total bits and split into sign/exponent/mantissa. FP32 (32 bits): 1+8+23, range 10^-38 to 10^38, precision 7 decimals. FP16 (16 bits): 1+5+10, range 10^-5 to 10^5, precision 3 decimals. BF16 (16 bits): 1+8+7, range of FP32, precision 2 decimals. FP8 E4M3 (8 bits): 1+4+3, range ±240, very rough. INT8 (8 bits): sign+7 value, uniform grid -128..127. INT4 (4 bits): 1+3, uniform grid -8..7.

Figure 13.2 tours the formats you will encounter in modern inference:

* **FP32**: the default for general compute, almost never used for LLM inference weights.
* **FP16**: the first-generation lower-precision format for ML. Narrower exponent (5 bits) means numerical range is only 10^-5 to 10^5, which causes training instability. Still widely used for inference because inference does not need the training-time dynamic range.
* **BF16**: Google's "brain float," keeps FP32's 8-bit exponent but chops the mantissa to 7 bits. Total is 16 bits. Dynamic range matches FP32 (no overflow issues), precision is lower. Modern training default.
* **FP8**: two variants. E4M3 (4 exponent bits, 3 mantissa bits) has higher precision, range ±240. E5M2 (5 exp, 2 mantissa) has wider range, lower precision. DeepSeek-V3 and Hopper/Blackwell ships with native FP8 tensor cores.
* **INT8**: no exponent. A uniform integer grid from -128 to 127, with a per-tensor scale factor to map real values to integers. Discretization error is significant but manageable.
* **INT4**: the same, with only 16 discrete values per tensor. Quality loss requires more careful handling.

The pattern: each step down doubles the compute ceiling (on hardware that supports the format) and halves the bytes per weight. Each step down also narrows the representable values, forcing more care about rounding.

### 13.4: The quantization operation: symmetric and asymmetric

Once we pick a low-precision target format, we need a rule that maps high-precision values to low-precision ones. The two major choices are **symmetric** and **asymmetric** quantization.

![Figure 13.3: Symmetric quantization](figures/ch13-fig3-symmetric-quantization/final.png)
*Figure 13.3.* Left panel: an FP32 axis from -2.5 to +2.5 with five example values marked. Label: "α = max|value| = 2.3." Center: an arrow labeled "scale = α / 127." Right panel: an INT8 axis from -127 to +127, with the five FP32 values mapped to integer positions: -111, -39, 0, 61, 127. Formula: "q = round(x / scale), x\_dequantized = q · scale." Annotation: "Zero maps to zero. Simple and fast."

Figure 13.3 shows symmetric quantization. You pick the absolute maximum value in the tensor (`α = max|x|`). You divide the target integer range symmetrically around zero, for INT8, that is -127 to +127, and set a scale factor of `α / 127`. Every value `x` is encoded as `q = round(x / scale)`, and decoded back as `x_dequantized = q · scale`.

Symmetric quantization has two strengths: (1) the math is trivial; (2) zero in FP maps exactly to zero in int. Trading for: (1) if your data is asymmetric around zero (e.g., post-ReLU activations are all ≥ 0), half the quantization range is wasted.

![Figure 13.4: Asymmetric quantization](figures/ch13-fig4-asymmetric-quantization/final.png)
*Figure 13.4.* Left panel: an FP32 axis from 0 to 5.0 (asymmetric, e.g., ReLU activations). Values 0.1, 0.4, 2.0, 3.7, 4.8. Center: arrow labeled "scale = (β - α) / 255; zero\_point = -round(α / scale)." Right panel: UINT8 axis from 0 to 255. Values mapped via q = round(x / scale) + zero\_point. Formulas side by side: symmetric and asymmetric. Annotation: "Symmetric for weights, asymmetric for activations."

Figure 13.4 adds asymmetric quantization. Instead of fixing zero at zero, you allow a shift (the "zero\_point") so the quantization range exactly covers the observed min/max of the data. This is ideal for asymmetric distributions, activations that have been ReLU'd, attention scores after softmax (all in [0, 1]), etc.

The production rule: **symmetric for weights, asymmetric for activations**. Weights are roughly zero-centered; activations often are not.

### 13.4.1: Both rules, worked element by element

Run both rules on the same vector so you can see the rounding, the error, and where the two methods differ. This is the kind of trace you would see if you printed per-element values inside a real quantization kernel.

**Input FP32 vector** (8 elements, as might come from one row of a weight matrix):

```
x = [3.08,  -0.42,  10.80,  -1.30,  7.66,  3.02,  -5.15,  4.20]
```

![Figure 13.4.1: Symmetric vs asymmetric quantization traced element by element](figures/ch13-fig4-1-quant-trace-matrix/final.png)
*Figure 13.4.1.* An 8-row × 6-column matrix. Rows are the eight values of x. Columns: "FP32 value", "Symmetric q (INT8)", "Symmetric dequant", "Symmetric error", "Asymmetric q (INT8)", "Asymmetric dequant", "Asymmetric error". Values filled in from the trace below. The row for x[5] = 3.02 is highlighted because it is the worst symmetric case (error 0.041), resolved under asymmetric (error 0.018). At the bottom, two summary cells: "Sym mean error = 0.021", "Asym mean error = 0.019".

**Symmetric INT8 quantization.** The rule: pick the absolute max, scale to the 127 end of the signed INT8 range, round.

```
α = max(|x|) = max(3.08, 0.42, 10.80, 1.30, 7.66, 3.02, 5.15, 4.20) = 10.80
scale = α / 127 = 10.80 / 127 = 0.08504
```

Encode each element as `q = round(x / scale)`, then decode as `x̂ = q · scale`:

| i | x | q = round(x / 0.08504) | x̂ = q · 0.08504 | abs error |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 3.08 | 36 | 3.061 | 0.019 |
| 1 | -0.42 | -5 | -0.425 | 0.005 |
| 2 | 10.80 | 127 | 10.800 | 0.000 |
| 3 | -1.30 | -15 | -1.276 | 0.024 |
| 4 | 7.66 | 90 | 7.654 | 0.006 |
| 5 | 3.02 | 36 | 3.061 | 0.041 |
| 6 | -5.15 | -61 | -5.187 | 0.037 |
| 7 | 4.20 | 49 | 4.167 | 0.033 |

Look at rows 0 and 5. Both encode to the same integer 36. After dequantization they both become 3.061. `x[0] = 3.08` and `x[5] = 3.02` have collided — they are indistinguishable in the quantized representation. This is the information loss that quantization fundamentally imposes. Maximum possible error under symmetric INT8 is `scale/2 = 0.043`, and row 5 saturates it (0.041).

**Asymmetric INT8 quantization.** Same vector, different rule: map the actual `[min, max]` range to `[-128, 127]`, with a zero-point shift.

```
α = max(x) = 10.80
β = min(x) = -5.15
scale = (α - β) / 255 = 15.95 / 255 = 0.06255
zero_point z = round(-128 - β / scale) = round(-128 + 82.3) = -46
```

Encode as `q = clamp(round(x / scale + z), -128, 127)`, decode as `x̂ = (q - z) · scale`:

| i | x | q (asym) | x̂ (asym) | abs err (asym) | abs err (sym) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 3.08 | 3 | 3.065 | 0.015 | 0.019 |
| 1 | -0.42 | -53 | -0.438 | 0.018 | 0.005 |
| 2 | 10.80 | 127 | 10.821 | 0.021 | 0.000 |
| 3 | -1.30 | -67 | -1.314 | 0.014 | 0.024 |
| 4 | 7.66 | 77 | 7.694 | 0.034 | 0.006 |
| 5 | 3.02 | 2 | 3.002 | 0.018 | 0.041 |
| 6 | -5.15 | -128 | -5.129 | 0.021 | 0.037 |
| 7 | 4.20 | 21 | 4.191 | 0.009 | 0.033 |

Mean absolute error: symmetric = 0.021, asymmetric = 0.019. Asymmetric wins on average because it uses more of the 256-level grid — `x[5] = 3.02` and `x[0] = 3.08` no longer collide (they map to 2 and 3 respectively). The cost is the extra zero-point in the arithmetic: each dequantization becomes `(q - z) · scale` instead of just `q · scale`. For activations (often one-sided after ReLU, so β ≠ −α), the extra bit of math is a small price for the much larger grid utilization. For weights (roughly symmetric around zero), the asymmetry gives little and the simpler symmetric rule wins.

**Outliers change everything.** If the vector has a single extreme value, symmetric collapse:

```
x_outlier = [1.20, -0.85, 0.33, -1.10, 0.76, -0.48, 0.92, 80.00]
α = 80.00 → scale = 80.00 / 127 = 0.6299
```

Quantizing `1.20`: `round(1.20 / 0.6299) = round(1.9) = 2`. Dequantized: `2 × 0.6299 = 1.260`. Error = 0.060 — five times worse than the non-outlier case. All the "normal" values are squeezed into the `[-2, 2]` sub-range of INT8's `[-127, 127]` — they use only 1.6% of the representable grid. One outlier destroys the precision of every non-outlier. This is the entire motivation for **group-wise quantization** (group\_size = 128 in GPTQ/AWQ) and for SmoothQuant's outlier-migration trick.

### 13.5: Two paradigms: weight-only vs W8A8

Now the architectural question: which tensors do you quantize? Two production-grade paradigms.

![Figure 13.5: Weight-only vs W8A8 quantization schemes](figures/ch13-fig5-weight-only-vs-w8a8/final.png)
*Figure 13.5.* Two panels. Top: "Weight-only (GPTQ, AWQ, bitsandbytes NF4)." A flow showing weights stored as INT4, dequantized to FP16 on-the-fly, FP16 matmul with FP16 activations, FP16 output. Annotation: "Savings come from less HBM traffic; compute is still full FP16." Bottom: "W8A8 (LLM.int8, SmoothQuant, DeepSeek FP8)." A flow showing weights stored as INT8/FP8 + activations quantized to INT8/FP8, INT8/FP8 tensor core matmul, accumulate in INT32/FP32, dequantize to FP16. Annotation: "Savings come from both HBM bandwidth AND faster quantized tensor core compute."

Figure 13.5 shows the two paradigms.

**Weight-only quantization** stores weights at low precision but runs the actual matmul at FP16. At load time, weights are either stored quantized and dequantized on-the-fly during matmul (GPTQ, AWQ), or the matmul itself uses a "mixed-precision" kernel that reads quantized weights and produces FP16 output. The benefit: fewer bytes read from HBM per forward pass. The limitation: compute is still bounded by the FP16 tensor core ceiling (989 TFLOPS on H100).

This is the most common production choice today. It is simple, preserves quality well, and works on any GPU with FP16 support. AWQ, GPTQ, bitsandbytes' NF4 format, and GGUF all use this paradigm.

**W8A8 (or W8A8-like) quantization** stores weights *and* runs the matmul at low precision, accumulating at higher precision to avoid overflow. The benefit: twice the HBM bandwidth savings (activations are also smaller) *and* access to the higher-TFLOPS tensor core paths (INT8 at 1979 TFLOPS on H100; FP8 at 1979 TFLOPS). The limitation: activations are harder to quantize without quality loss, especially under specific distributions of outliers.

DeepSeek-V3 is the most prominent W8A8 deployment, running FP8 throughout. TensorRT-LLM supports W8A8 with SmoothQuant's outlier-handling tricks. vLLM's FP8 support uses W8A8.

### 13.6: GPTQ: calibrated weight-only quantization

Let us walk through a specific production algorithm: GPTQ (Frantar et al., 2023). GPTQ is the workhorse of 4-bit weight quantization in open-source inference stacks.

![Figure 13.6: GPTQ: iterative quantization with error propagation](figures/ch13-fig6-gptq-iterative/final.png)
*Figure 13.6.* A four-step vertical flow. Step 1: "Start with FP32 weights w = [w1, w2, w3]." Values shown: 0.45, -0.78, 0.32. Step 2: "Quantize w1 to INT4. Rounding error e\_1 = 0.03. Propagate: w2' = w2 + (e\_1 · H^-1[1,2]), w3' = w3 + (e\_1 · H^-1[1,3]) where H^-1 is the inverse Hessian." Step 3: "Quantize w2', propagate error to w3." Step 4: "Quantize w3. Done. Final weights compensate for each other's errors." Side callout: "The Hessian tells us which weights are sensitive to rounding."

Figure 13.6 shows GPTQ's key idea: quantize weights one at a time, and after each rounding error, adjust the remaining weights to compensate. The adjustment uses the **inverse Hessian** of the layer's output with respect to the weights, a measure of how sensitive each weight is to perturbation.

GPTQ runs through the layer's weights in a specific order. For each weight:

1. Round it to the nearest INT4 level. Record the rounding error.
2. Compute adjusted values for all remaining unquantized weights, using the inverse Hessian to route the error appropriately.
3. Move to the next weight.

The net effect: the final quantized weights, when multiplied by inputs, produce outputs much closer to the original FP32 model than naive rounding would. On Llama-2 70B, GPTQ achieves ~3.5 bits per weight with less than 1% perplexity loss.

The algorithm requires a **calibration dataset**, ~128 samples, to estimate the Hessian. In production, GPTQ is a one-time operation at model-prep time; the quantized weights are then stored as artifacts and loaded directly.

### 13.6.1: GPTQ, traced through three weights

Formulas alone do not show why redistribution wins. Let us quantize a 3-weight row by hand and watch the error shift.

**Setup.**

```
w = [1.33, 0.28, -0.79]            (FP32 row of weights)
scale = 0.20                       (INT4 quantization grid)
H⁻¹ = [h₁, h₂, h₃] = [0.50, 1.20, 0.30]   (diagonal inverse Hessian)
```

The inverse Hessian tells us how output-sensitive each weight is. **Low H⁻¹ = more important**, because small perturbations cause large output changes. So `w[2]` (h = 0.30) is the most important weight in this row; `w[1]` (h = 1.20) is the least important.

![Figure 13.6.1: GPTQ error redistribution across three weights](figures/ch13-fig6-1-gptq-error-flow/final.png)
*Figure 13.6.1.* A three-column diagram. Column 1 shows the original weight row `[1.33, 0.28, -0.79]` with H⁻¹ annotations. Column 2 shows the weight-by-weight quantization with red arrows indicating error flowing from already-quantized weights to not-yet-quantized weights, scaled by the Hessian ratio. Column 3 shows the final quantized row `[7, 2, -4]` in INT4 and the dequantized reconstruction. An annotation at the bottom: "Error routed preferentially to high-H⁻¹ (less important) weights."

**Iteration 1: quantize w[0] = 1.33.**

```
q[0] = round(1.33 / 0.20) = round(6.65) = 7
ŵ[0] = 7 · 0.20 = 1.40
δ₀  = w[0] − ŵ[0] = 1.33 − 1.40 = −0.07      (we rounded up, so error is negative)

Redistribute δ₀ to remaining weights, weighted by H⁻¹:
w[1] ← w[1] − δ₀ · (h₂ / h₁) = 0.28 − (−0.07)(1.20/0.50)·(0.50) = 0.28 + 0.168 = 0.448
w[2] ← w[2] − δ₀ · (h₃ / h₁) = −0.79 + 0.042 = −0.748
```

Notice the asymmetry: `w[1]` moves by +0.168, `w[2]` moves by only +0.042. The high-tolerance weight (h₂ = 1.20) absorbs most of the correction, because nudging `w[1]` around barely affects the output. The important weight (h₃ = 0.30) is left nearly alone, preserving its precision.

**Iteration 2: quantize the updated w[1] = 0.448.**

```
q[1] = round(0.448 / 0.20) = round(2.24) = 2
ŵ[1] = 2 · 0.20 = 0.40
δ₁  = 0.448 − 0.40 = 0.048

w[2] ← −0.748 − 0.048 · (h₃ / h₂) · (h₂ / h₃) · weighting ≈ −0.748 − 0.012 = −0.760
```

The leftover error in w[1] (only 0.048) again routes preferentially to the less-important weight, but there is only one left, so w[2] absorbs the whole thing.

**Iteration 3: quantize w[2] = −0.760.**

```
q[2] = round(−0.760 / 0.20) = round(−3.80) = −4
ŵ[2] = −4 · 0.20 = −0.80
```

Done. The final quantized row is `q = [7, 2, −4]`, dequantized to `[1.40, 0.40, −0.80]`.

**Compare to naive rounding.**

| Weight | Original | GPTQ | GPTQ error | Naive | Naive error | Importance (1/H⁻¹) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| w[0] | 1.33 | 1.40 | 0.07 | 1.40 | 0.07 | 2.0 (mid) |
| w[1] | 0.28 | 0.40 | 0.12 | 0.20 | 0.08 | 0.83 (low) |
| w[2] | −0.79 | −0.80 | 0.01 | −0.80 | 0.01 | 3.33 (high) |

GPTQ's per-weight error on `w[1]` is *larger* than naive (0.12 vs 0.08). But `w[1]` is the least important weight — its errors barely propagate to the output. Meanwhile the critical weight `w[2]` has an error of just 0.01 under both schemes. What matters is the *output-weighted error* summed over the row: GPTQ sacrifices precision on a weight that does not matter to protect the weights that do. Over thousands of weights per row, this asymmetric allocation compounds into dramatically smaller total output error than naive independent rounding. That is why GPTQ achieves ~3.5 bits per weight on Llama-2-70B with less than 1% perplexity loss, while naive INT4 would collapse the model.

### 13.7: GGUF: block-based hierarchical quantization

GGUF is the format used by `llama.cpp` and Ollama. Its claim to fame: **run a 70B model on a MacBook** via aggressive quantization and CPU+GPU offloading.

![Figure 13.7: GGUF block hierarchy: two levels of scales](figures/ch13-fig7-gguf-block-hierarchy/final.png)
*Figure 13.7.* A central super-block with 8 sub-blocks, each containing 32 INT4 weights. Each sub-block: one sub-block scale (stored as INT8). The super-block: one super-block scale (stored as FP16). Formula: "w\_real = sub\_block\_scale × super\_block\_scale × w\_int4." Annotation: "Two levels prevent per-block scale overhead from dominating."

Figure 13.7 shows the GGUF data layout. Weights are stored as INT4 values. Every 32 INT4 weights share one INT8 "sub-block scale." Every 256 INT4 weights (8 sub-blocks) share one FP16 "super-block scale." The actual weight is:

```
w_real = sub_block_scale × super_block_scale × w_int4
```

Two levels of scales let GGUF capture per-region variation without storing FP16 scales for every tiny group. The total bits per weight is slightly above 4, typically 4.5 to 6.25 depending on the specific "K-quant" variant, because of the scale overhead. In exchange, quality is often better than strict 4-bit GPTQ, especially for smaller models.

GGUF also supports mixed precision within a single model. Some layers can be stored at 5 bits, others at 3 bits, based on empirical sensitivity. `llama.cpp` ships with multiple "levels" (Q2\_K, Q3\_K\_S, Q4\_K\_M, Q5\_K\_M, Q6\_K, Q8\_0), trading bits for quality.

The reason GGUF dominates the on-device segment of the market: the format is portable (same file runs on Mac, Linux, Windows, CPU-only, GPU-offload), the quantization is good enough for most uses, and the tooling (Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp) is accessible to non-specialists.

### 13.7.1: The two-level scale chain, traced

The two-level scheme is easier to feel when you run it numerically. Take a super-block of 256 weights split into 8 sub-blocks of 32, and trace one weight end to end.

**Sub-block 1** (32 weights, show first 3): `[0.42, -0.18, 0.77, ...]`

```
α₁ = max(|·|) = 0.91
scale_sub₁ (FP32) = 0.91 / 7 = 0.13             (INT4 symmetric uses [-8, 7])
Quantize:  0.42 / 0.13 =  3.2 → 3               (stored as 4 bits)
          -0.18 / 0.13 = -1.4 → -1
           0.77 / 0.13 =  5.9 → 6
```

**Sub-block 2** has a different local range because its weights are larger:

```
α₂ = 2.10 → scale_sub₂ = 0.30
```

Across all 8 sub-blocks, the FP32 sub-block scales come out to:

```
[0.13, 0.30, 0.08, 0.17, 0.11, 0.25, 0.06, 0.19]
```

Storing those 8 scales as FP32 would be 8 × 32 = 256 bits of overhead. GGUF quantizes them with a single super-block scale:

```
α_super = max(scales) = 0.30
scale_super = 0.30 / 127 = 0.00236              (stored as FP16)

Quantize sub-scales → INT8:
  0.13 / 0.00236 ≈ 55
  0.30 / 0.00236 ≈ 127
  0.08 / 0.00236 ≈ 34
  0.17 / 0.00236 ≈ 72
  ...
```

**On-disk footprint** for 256 weights:

```
weights:     256 × 4 bits  = 1024 bits    (INT4 grid index)
sub-scales:    8 × 8 bits  =   64 bits    (INT8, per sub-block)
super-scale:   1 × 16 bits =   16 bits    (FP16, per super-block)
──────────────────────────────────────
total:       1104 bits / 256 weights = 4.3 bits/weight
```

![Figure 13.7.1: Two-level scale chain at quantize and at inference time](figures/ch13-fig7-1-gguf-scale-chain/final.png)
*Figure 13.7.1.* A horizontal two-row layout. Top row (quantize, one-time): FP32 weight → divide by sub-block scale → INT4 grid index. In parallel, FP32 sub-scale → divide by super-scale → INT8. Bottom row (dequantize at inference): INT4 × (INT8 × FP16) → FP32 weight. Arrows connect the two, with labels "one-time at save" and "every forward pass". A side annotation: "1104 bits store 256 weights (4.3 bits/weight), yet every weight is reconstructed by two multiplications."

**Dequantization at inference** for weight w₁[0] (stored as INT4 value `3` in sub-block 1):

```
Step 1: scale_sub₁ = INT8(55) × FP16(0.00236)  = 0.1298
Step 2: ŵ₁[0]     = INT4(3)  × 0.1298          = 0.3894    (orig 0.42, err 0.031)
```

For a weight in sub-block 2 (the one with bigger values):

```
Step 1: scale_sub₂ = INT8(127) × 0.00236 = 0.2997
Step 2: ŵ₂[0]      = INT4(5)   × 0.2997   = 1.4985         (orig 1.45, err 0.049)
```

Every weight pays the cost of two multiplications. In exchange, the representation is 4.3 bits/weight instead of 16 bits/weight — a 3.7× reduction with local scales that adapt to each 32-element neighborhood's own range. This is why a 70B model fits in ~35 GB on a consumer-grade Mac.

### 13.7.2: The GGUF level zoo — Q4\_0, Q4\_1, Q4\_K\_M, Q5\_K\_M, Q6\_K, Q8\_0, Q2\_K

The `Q4_K_M` above is one of many GGUF quantization levels. When you download a `.gguf` file you will see names like `llama-70b-Q4_K_M.gguf`, `llama-70b-Q5_K_S.gguf`, `llama-70b-Q2_K.gguf`. The naming is systematic:

```
Q4_K_M
│ │ │
│ │ └── Size variant: S = small, M = medium, L = large
│ │     (how much of the model uses higher-bit layers vs this one)
│ │
│ └──── K = "K-quant" (the two-level super/sub block scheme from §13.7.1)
│       No "K" means the older one-level scheme (Q4_0, Q4_1, Q8_0)
│
└───── Number of bits per weight (4 = INT4)
```

Each level stakes out a different point on the bits-per-weight × quality frontier. Here is the full zoo, each with its actual per-block accounting.

![Figure 13.7.2: GGUF level comparison on Llama-3-70B](figures/ch13-fig7-2-gguf-level-zoo/final.png)
*Figure 13.7.2.* A horizontal stacked bar chart. X-axis: memory footprint in GB for Llama-3-70B at each level. Seven rows, each labeled with a Q-level name plus a short quality descriptor: Q8\_0 (66 GB, "barely any loss"), Q6\_K (54 GB, "almost perfect"), Q5\_K\_M (48 GB, "very good"), Q4\_K\_M (42 GB, "sweet spot"), Q4\_K\_S (40 GB, "good"), Q4\_0 (39 GB, "decent"), Q3\_K\_M (33 GB, "noticeable loss"), Q2\_K (27 GB, "significant loss"). Color gradient: Q8\_0 green, Q4\_K\_M yellow-gold, Q2\_K orange-red. Annotation: "Q4\_K\_M is the community default; Q2\_K is experimental."

**Q4\_0 — the simplest 4-bit (no super blocks).** Block size 32 weights. Each block stores:

```
32 weights × 4 bits   = 128 bits
1 FP16 scale           =  16 bits
──────────────────────────────────
total per block        = 144 bits   →  4.5 bits/weight
```

Uses the plain symmetric rule: `scale = max(|block|) / 7`, integer grid `[-8, 7]`. Fast to dequantize — one multiply per weight, no min, no zero-point. But no super-block amortization of scale overhead and no asymmetric handling. Worked example on 8 weights:

```
weights:    [0.42, -0.18, 0.77, -0.55, 0.03, 0.91, -0.33, 0.68]
scale:      0.91 / 7 = 0.13
quantized:  [3, -1,  6, -4,  0,  7, -3,  5]
dequant:    [0.39, -0.13, 0.78, -0.52, 0.00, 0.91, -0.39, 0.65]
errors:     [0.03,  0.05, 0.01, 0.03, 0.03, 0.00, 0.06, 0.03]        mean 0.030
```

**Q4\_1 — 4-bit asymmetric.** Block size 32. Each block stores the INT4 weights plus an FP16 scale *and* an FP16 min:

```
32 × 4 + 16 + 16 = 160 bits per block   →  5.0 bits/weight
```

Uses asymmetric mapping to `[0, 15]`: `q = round((w - min) / scale)`, `dequant = q · scale + min`. On the same 8-weight block:

```
min  = -0.55,  max = 0.91
scale = 1.46 / 15 = 0.0973
quantized: [10, 4, 14, 0, 6, 15, 2, 13]
dequant:   [0.42, -0.16, 0.81, -0.55, 0.03, 0.91, -0.36, 0.72]
errors:    [0.00,  0.02, 0.04, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.03, 0.04]        mean 0.016
```

Mean error drops from 0.030 to 0.016 — almost half — because the full 16-level grid is used (Q4\_0 wastes half the grid on the negative side for centered data). The price is 0.5 extra bits/weight for the stored min.

**Q8\_0 — 8-bit high quality.** Block size 32, same shape as Q4\_0 with 8 bits per weight:

```
32 × 8 + 16 = 272 bits per block   →  8.5 bits/weight
```

Maps to `[-127, 127]`. Errors are so small they rarely affect model output — Q8\_0 is essentially indistinguishable from FP16 on standard benchmarks. Often used as an intermediate before further quantization or when VRAM is plentiful and quality matters.

**Q4\_K\_M — the K-quant sweet spot.** Two-level scheme (from §13.7.1), 256-weight super block with 8 sub-blocks of 32, *both* sub-scale *and* sub-min quantized to INT8:

```
weights:     256 × 4     = 1024 bits
sub scales:    8 × 8     =   64 bits
sub mins:      8 × 8     =   64 bits
super scale:       16    =   16 bits
super min:         16    =   16 bits
────────────────────────────────────
total:                   = 1184 bits   →  4.625 bits/weight
```

The `M` means "medium mixed": attention layers (more quantization-sensitive) use Q6\_K, feed-forward layers (less sensitive) use Q4\_K. This mixed-precision approach gives noticeably better quality than uniform Q4\_K everywhere for roughly the same storage cost.

Dequantization of one weight requires the full two-level chain:

```
Step 1: scale_sub = INT8(107) × FP16(0.00236) = 0.2525
Step 2: min_sub   = INT8(85)  × FP16(-0.00310) = -0.2635
Step 3: w         = INT4(12) · 0.2525 + (-0.2635) = 3.030 - 0.2635 = 2.767
```

**Q2\_K — extreme 2-bit compression.** Super block 256 weights, 16 sub-blocks of 16 weights each; each sub-block stores an INT4 scale *and* an INT4 min (not INT8):

```
weights:    256 × 2     =  512 bits
sub scales:  16 × 4     =   64 bits
sub mins:    16 × 4     =   64 bits
super scale:    16      =   16 bits
super min:      16      =   16 bits
────────────────────────────────────
total:                  =  672 bits   →  2.625 bits/weight
```

Each weight is one of only 4 values (0, 1, 2, 3, unsigned). On a sub-block with range `[-0.45, 0.82]` the four representable values are:

```
scale = (0.82 - (-0.45)) / 3 = 0.423
0 → -0.450
1 → -0.027
2 →  0.397
3 →  0.820
```

A weight of 0.10 has to map to `1 → -0.027`, error 0.127. A weight of 0.33 maps to `2 → 0.397`, error 0.067. Only four distinct values per sub-block is genuinely lossy; Q2\_K is best treated as experimental.

**The practical guide.** Summarizing the footprint-vs-quality frontier at Llama-3-70B scale:

| Level | bits/weight | 70B size | Quality label |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Q8\_0 | 8.5 | 66 GB | barely any loss |
| Q6\_K | 6.6 | 54 GB | almost perfect |
| Q5\_K\_M | 5.7 | 48 GB | very good |
| Q4\_K\_M | 4.6 | 42 GB | **sweet spot** (community default) |
| Q4\_K\_S | 4.5 | 40 GB | good |
| Q4\_0 | 4.5 | 39 GB | decent |
| Q3\_K\_M | 3.9 | 33 GB | noticeable loss |
| Q2\_K | 2.6 | 27 GB | significant loss |

Rule of thumb: VRAM-rich → **Q8\_0**. Normal setup → **Q4\_K\_M** (best quality-per-bit). Tight on VRAM → **Q3\_K\_M** (usable for most tasks). **Q2\_K** only when size is absolutely critical.

### 13.8: Quantization-aware training (QAT)

All the above are **post-training quantization** (PTQ): take a trained FP16 model, apply a quantization algorithm, ship. PTQ is fast and cheap but has a ceiling on quality.

**Quantization-aware training** simulates quantization during training itself, letting the model adapt. The extra training time is offset by much better quantized quality, particularly for aggressive bit widths (INT4, INT2, or lower).

![Figure 13.8: QAT with fake quantization](figures/ch13-fig8-qat-fake-quantization/final.png)
*Figure 13.8.* A training-loop diagram. Top: a floating-point weight w\_fp32. Arrow labeled "fake quantize" pointing down to w\_fake\_q (quantized-then-dequantized, still FP32 type but snapped to the INT4 grid). This feeds into forward pass → loss → backward pass. A dashed arrow: "gradient flows BACK to w\_fp32 directly (straight-through estimator), skipping the non-differentiable round() step." Bottom annotation: "During inference, w\_fp32 is discarded; only w\_int4 is shipped."

Figure 13.8 shows the mechanism. During training, after each optimizer step on the FP32 weights, we apply a "fake quantization" operation that rounds the weight to the nearest INT4 grid point and then dequantizes back to FP32. The forward pass uses this quantized value. The loss and backward pass proceed normally, with one trick: the gradient flows around the non-differentiable `round` function via a **straight-through estimator** (treating `round` as the identity in the backward).

The net effect: the FP32 weights learn to sit at positions where rounding to INT4 is numerically benign.

#### 13.8.1: Why a naive backward pass freezes training

The `round` operation in fake quantization is a staircase. Its derivative is zero almost everywhere and undefined at the step boundaries:

```
 W_fq = round(W / scale) · scale

 dW_fq/dW  =  0   almost everywhere
```

A naive chain-rule calculation for the gradient of the loss with respect to the underlying float weight produces:

```
dL/dW  =  dL/dy · dy/dW_fq · dW_fq/dW
       =  (something) · (something) · 0
       =  0                                    ← disaster: no learning
```

Zero gradient means zero update. The float weight never moves. The model is frozen at its initial values.

The **straight-through estimator (STE)** is the fix. It is a deliberate lie: during the backward pass only, we pretend `round` is the identity function (derivative 1):

```
dW_fq/dW  :=  1                        during backward (STE)
dW_fq/dW   =  0                        true value (which we ignore)
```

Why the lie works: the *direction* the gradient is trying to communicate — "increase W" or "decrease W" to lower the loss — is correct regardless of the staircase. STE passes the direction through; the magnitude is approximately right. Eventually the float weight crosses a grid boundary, and the fake-quantized version snaps to a different integer level. That is how the model "learns which grid point is best."

#### 13.8.2: A five-iteration training trace

A single-neuron network makes every number in this loop visible. Same setup as a real training loop, just one weight.

```
Network:       y = W · x + b
Input:         x = 3.0
Bias:          b = 0.5    (frozen)
Target:        y_target = 2.0
Weight:        W_float (initial 0.42)
Learning rate: lr = 0.05
INT4 scale:    0.13   →   grid points ..., 0.26, 0.39, 0.52, 0.65, ...
Loss:          (y - y_target)²
```

![Figure 13.8.2: The QAT training loop with STE](figures/ch13-fig8-2-qat-training-loop/final.png)
*Figure 13.8.2.* Three horizontal lanes showing one iteration end-to-end. Top lane — forward pass: W\_float → "fake quantize" box (round to INT4, multiply by scale) → W\_fq → "y = W\_fq · x + b" → "loss = (y - y\_target)²". Middle lane — backward pass: loss → dL/dy → dy/dW\_fq → "STE shortcut: pretend dW\_fq/dW = 1" → dL/dW\_float. Bottom lane — update: "W\_float ← W\_float − lr · dL/dW", with a small inset showing W\_float drifting along a number line while W\_fq snaps discretely between grid points 0.39 and 0.52.

**Iteration 1.** `W_float = 0.42`.

```
Forward
  W_fq   = round(0.42 / 0.13) · 0.13 = round(3.23) · 0.13 = 3 · 0.13 = 0.39
  y      = 0.39 · 3.0 + 0.5 = 1.67
  loss   = (1.67 - 2.0)² = (-0.33)² = 0.1089

Backward (with STE)
  dL/dy       = 2 · (y - y_target) = -0.66
  dy/dW_fq    = x = 3.0
  dW_fq/dW    = 1                               ← STE lie
  dL/dW_float = -0.66 · 3.0 · 1 = -1.98

Update
  W_float ← 0.42 - 0.05 · (-1.98) = 0.42 + 0.099 = 0.519
```

The gradient correctly said "push W up"; STE let the message through even though `round` actually zeros it.

**Iteration 2.** `W_float = 0.519`. Now the rounding snaps to the *next* grid point:

```
Forward
  W_fq = round(0.519 / 0.13) · 0.13 = round(3.99) · 0.13 = 4 · 0.13 = 0.52
                                                               ↑ discrete jump
  y      = 0.52 · 3.0 + 0.5 = 2.06
  loss   = (2.06 - 2.0)² = 0.0036                   ← massive drop

Backward
  dL/dy       = 2 · 0.06 = 0.12
  dL/dW_float = 0.12 · 3.0 · 1 = 0.36

Update
  W_float ← 0.519 - 0.05 · 0.36 = 0.501
```

We overshot slightly (y = 2.06 > 2.0 = target), so the gradient now pushes W back down.

**Iterations 3 and 4.** `W_float` keeps drifting toward the boundary, but `W_fq` stays stuck at 0.52 because every value in [0.455, 0.585] rounds to grid index 4:

```
iter  W_float    W_fq    y      loss     gradient   comment
────  ───────    ────    ────   ──────   ────────   ─────────────────────────
 1    0.420      0.39    1.67   0.1089   -1.98      too low, push up
 2    0.519      0.52    2.06   0.0036   +0.36      overshot, push down
 3    0.501      0.52    2.06   0.0036   +0.36      still rounds to 0.52
 4    0.483      0.52    2.06   0.0036   +0.36      still rounds to 0.52
 5    0.465      0.52    2.06   0.0036   +0.36      approaching 0.455 boundary
```

**Iteration 6** (one step past the boundary). `W_float = 0.447` now crosses the 0.455 threshold and snaps to a *different* integer level:

```
W_fq = round(0.447 / 0.13) · 0.13 = round(3.44) · 0.13 = 3 · 0.13 = 0.39
y    = 0.39 · 3.0 + 0.5 = 1.67
loss = 0.1089                                     ← jumped back up!
```

The loss jumps because the fake-quantized weight flipped a level. The gradient immediately flips sign (large and positive → large and negative direction), pushing `W_float` back up. Over many iterations with a decaying learning rate, `W_float` settles into an oscillation *around* the best grid point — the one where `round(W_float / scale)` consistently picks the integer that minimizes loss (here, 4 → 0.52).

**Long-run settling.** After ~500 iterations of gradient descent with learning-rate decay, the trajectory converges:

```
W_float → 0.510    (oscillates in a tight band around 0.510)
W_fq    → 0.52     (always rounds to level 4)
loss    → 0.0036   (the best achievable at INT4 precision)
```

The model has *learned* that grid point 0.52 is where this weight should live. Put another way: given a choice of 16 discrete weight values that the INT4 grid allows, the optimizer found the one that minimizes task loss. That is fundamentally different from PTQ, which takes an already-trained weight and rounds it — whatever grid point happens to be closest is what you get, regardless of whether it is the best *available* grid point.

**What would happen without STE.** In iteration 1, `dW_fq/dW = 0` (the true derivative). Chain rule gives `dL/dW_float = -0.66 · 3.0 · 0 = 0`. Update: `W_float ← 0.42 - 0.05 · 0 = 0.42`. Next iteration: still 0.42. Training is frozen. This is precisely why the straight-through estimator was invented.

### 13.9: Why QAT beats PTQ: the wide-minimum phenomenon

Why does QAT produce better quantized models than PTQ? The common intuition is that QAT gives the model "more time to compensate." The deeper reason is about the loss landscape.

![Figure 13.9: Wide minima vs narrow minima](figures/ch13-fig9-wide-vs-narrow-minima/final.png)
*Figure 13.9.* A 1D loss curve L(w) plotted against weight w. Two local minima: a narrow valley with steep walls and low loss at bottom; a wide valley with gentle walls and slightly higher loss. Two dots, one in each valley. Red "X"s through both, labeled "if we quantize (round to grid), we jump up the walls." The narrow-valley dot jumps to a very high loss (steep walls). The wide-valley dot jumps to only slightly higher loss. Annotation: "QAT pushes the optimizer AWAY from narrow minima, INTO wide ones."

Figure 13.9 is the insight. A trained model typically sits at a local minimum of the loss function. If that minimum is a narrow valley (steep walls), small perturbations to the weights cause large loss increases, and quantization *is* a perturbation. If the minimum is a wide valley (gentle walls), the same perturbation causes only a small loss increase.

PTQ takes an arbitrary trained model and quantizes it. If the model happens to be in a narrow valley, quantized quality is bad, unavoidably.

QAT forces the model, during training, to optimize *in the presence of* quantization noise. The optimizer naturally steers toward wide valleys, where a little noise doesn't matter. When you quantize a QAT-trained model for inference, you are already at a wide minimum, and rounding is cheap.

This is why BitNet, the 1.58-bit quantization we see next, works at all: BitNet is QAT-trained from scratch at ternary precision, sitting in very wide minima by construction.

### 13.10: BitNet 1.58b: ternary weights

The frontier of aggressive quantization: weights in {-1, 0, +1}, which is 1.58 bits (log2(3)). This is the most extreme mainstream quantization scheme, introduced by Microsoft Research in early 2024.

![Figure 13.10: BitNet 1.58b: weights in {-1, 0, +1}](figures/ch13-fig10-bitnet-158b/final.png)
*Figure 13.10.* Top: a 16-cell weight matrix with each cell colored in one of three shades. Label: "log2(3) = 1.58 bits per weight." Center: a matmul visualization showing input X (INT8) × W (ternary {-1, 0, +1}). Annotation: "Ternary weights turn matmul into ADDITIONS ONLY. ~30% of weights are zero, sparsity skips those entirely." Right panel: a bar chart comparing energy per matmul, FP16: 1.0× baseline; INT8: 0.4×; BitNet 1.58b: 0.07×.

Figure 13.10 shows BitNet. Each weight is one of three values: -1, 0, or +1. A matmul `y = W · x` becomes a series of additions: whenever `w = +1`, add `x`; when `w = -1`, subtract `x`; when `w = 0`, skip.

This is transformative for hardware. No multiplications are needed, only additions. Multiplications are the most energy-expensive arithmetic operations; eliminating them reduces energy per matmul by roughly 14× (per Microsoft's measurements). It also enables specialized hardware (FPGAs, ASICs) to pack many more operations per unit area, because ternary-specific ALUs are much smaller than floating-point ones.

BitNet requires QAT from scratch, you cannot take a trained FP16 model and post-train-quantize it to 1.58 bits with reasonable quality. But a model trained with ternary quantization throughout hits 98-99% of a full-precision model's quality, at one-tenth the compute cost.

As of 2026, BitNet-style models are still mostly research, not production. The economics are compelling enough (10× energy savings at matched quality) that major labs are investigating. If BitNet-scale models become standard, the entire inference hardware landscape shifts, CPUs become viable again for large-model inference, energy costs drop 10×, and on-device LLMs become trivially feasible.

## Where Quantization Places Us on the Roofline

### 13.11: Two simultaneous movements

Quantization is the rare technique that moves the roofline operating point in two ways at once.

**Movement 1: fewer bytes per weight.** A 70B-parameter model at FP16 is 140 GB; at INT4 it is 35 GB. Per decode step, fewer bytes must flow through HBM. Arithmetic intensity (FLOPs / bytes) rises by 4×. The operating point moves *right*.

**Movement 2: higher compute ceiling.** On H100, FP16 tensor cores hit 989 TFLOPS. FP8 hits 1,979 TFLOPS (2×). INT4 hits 3,958 TFLOPS (4×). Quantizing to FP8 or INT4 gives access to a different, higher ceiling. The operating point can go *up*.

Combined: the operating point moves up-and-right, into a more compute-bound regime with a higher ceiling. For models that were memory-bound under FP16 (which is almost all of them during decode), quantization delivers a large end-to-end speedup.

Real-world measurement: INT4-quantized Llama-3-70B on H100 delivers roughly 2.5× more tokens per GPU-hour than FP16 on the same hardware. FP8 gives ~2×. The exact numbers depend on the kernel implementation and the model's specific architecture, but the pattern, quantization wins in both memory and compute regimes, is consistent.

### 13.12: The composition with everything else

Quantization composes with every technique from Chapters 8-12:

* **GQA** + **FP8**: half the cache bytes for being GQA, another half for being FP8 → 4× total reduction.
* **MLA** + **FP8**: MLA's ~8× cache compression × FP8's 2× → 16× reduction vs MHA/FP16.
* **FlashAttention** runs naturally on any precision its kernel supports. FA-3 on H100 supports FP8; FA-2 supports FP16.
* **PagedAttention** stores the KV cache in whatever precision you pick; FP8 KV cache is common in 2026.
* **Prefix caching** caches K/V blocks at whatever precision they were computed in.
* **Continuous batching** is orthogonal to precision.

This multiplicative stacking is why modern serving engines have reached per-token costs 50-100× lower than the baseline naive implementations.

### 13.13: What quantization does not solve

Two things:

**Outliers.** Some activations in LLMs are ~10× larger than their typical values, and they dominate the quantization error budget. SmoothQuant handles this by "moving" the outlier magnitude from activations to weights. AWQ does it by leaving certain weight channels at higher precision. BitNet avoids it by training the model to not produce outliers. All production schemes handle outliers somehow.

**Non-linear operations.** Softmax, LayerNorm, GELU, residual connections, all involve operations that don't benefit much from quantization (they are not dominated by matmul). In practice, these are left at higher precision (FP16 or BF16) even in INT4-weight models.

### 13.14: When to pick which quantization

A quick decision matrix for production:

* **GPTQ or AWQ 4-bit (weight-only)**: the default. Works on any GPU with FP16 tensor cores. Minimal quality loss.
* **FP8 (W8A8)**: best choice on Hopper (H100) or Blackwell (B100/B200). Largest compute-ceiling gain.
* **GGUF K-quants**: for CPU or local/on-device inference. Mature tooling.
* **QAT**: when you control the training pipeline and want the best possible quality at aggressive bit widths (INT3 or below).
* **BitNet-style ternary**: experimental; worth watching.

### 13.15: Where we go next

Chapter 14 returns to the scheduling layer. We have been assuming throughout these chapters that many users share a GPU, that forward passes aggregate their decode steps, that batches are "continuous." Chapter 14 makes all of that explicit, how continuous batching works, why it requires PagedAttention, and how the scheduler decides what goes into each forward pass.

# Chapter 14: Continuous Batching

Chapters 7 through 13 optimized the *bytes* of inference, what gets stored, how it is laid out, how big each number is. Chapter 14 addresses something orthogonal: **what goes into each forward pass**. Even with perfect byte optimization, a serving engine that runs one user's decode at a time wastes the GPU, the same weight-load that could produce one token could instead produce 32 tokens if 32 users' decode steps rode along on the same forward pass.

That is the idea of **continuous batching** (sometimes called "dynamic batching" or "iteration-level scheduling"). Pack as many active users into every forward pass as fit within the GPU's memory and compute budget. When a user's sequence finishes, their slot immediately goes to the next waiting user, no need to wait for a "batch" to complete.

Continuous batching is what makes PagedAttention economically meaningful. It is what makes chunked prefill work. It is what modern serving engines, vLLM, SGLang, TensorRT-LLM, are built around. And it is the single biggest reason a well-tuned H100 serves 50× more tokens per second than the same hardware running a naive one-sequence-at-a-time loop.

This chapter is shorter than the previous three because the idea is simpler. But the idea is load-bearing for everything that follows, so we will take the time to trace through exactly how scheduling works, what parameters govern it, and what the trade-offs are.

## Static Batching's Fatal Flaw

### 14.1: Why static batching is wrong for LLMs

In traditional machine-learning inference, a "batch" is a fixed group of inputs that are processed together and then emitted together. Image classification, recommendation models, tabular predictions, all fine with static batching. You wait for N inputs to accumulate, you run them through the model, you get N outputs, you send them off.

LLMs are different because **output lengths vary enormously**. One user asks "what time is it?", three tokens. Another user asks "write a detailed essay about...", 2000 tokens. If you bundle them in a static batch, you either have to process them at the shortest output (the essay gets cut off) or the longest (the three-token query waits idle for 2000 tokens of decode on its neighbor).

![Figure 14.1: Static batching: the slowest sequence blocks the batch](figures/ch14-fig1-static-batching-problem/final.png)
*Figure 14.1.* A four-row timeline, one row per user. User A: decodes 512 tokens, finishes at t=10s. User B: 32 tokens, finishes at t=1s, then sits idle until t=10s (big grey "waiting" bar). User C: 80 tokens, finishes at t=2s, idle to t=10s. User D: 200 tokens, finishes at t=5s, idle to t=10s. Annotation: "Static batch finishes when the LONGEST sequence finishes. 3 of 4 users waste their slot."

Figure 14.1 shows the pathology. In a static batch of 4 users, the batch takes as long as the slowest user. Three of the four users finish early and sit idle, holding onto a GPU slot that no one else can use. Effective throughput is a fraction of what it could be.

The extreme version of this: a batch of 1. A single-user stream. GPU spends 99% of its time waiting for sequential decode steps, effective throughput ~5-10% of peak. Almost every naive PyTorch LLM inference script runs in this regime.

### 14.2: The continuous alternative

Continuous batching fixes this by **letting sequences join and leave the batch dynamically**, between forward passes.

![Figure 14.2: Continuous batching: sequences join and leave dynamically](figures/ch14-fig2-continuous-batching/final.png)
*Figure 14.2.* Same four-row timeline. User A runs t=0 to t=10s. User B runs t=0 to t=1s, then User B2 arrives at t=1s and runs to t=6s, then B3 at t=6 to t=9. User C: t=0 to t=2s, then C2 arrives at t=2s and runs to t=8s. User D: t=0 to t=5s, then D2 arrives at t=5s and runs to t=10s. Annotation: "As soon as a sequence finishes, its slot is filled by the next waiting user."

Figure 14.2 shows the alternative. The batch slot of User B, freed at t=1s, is immediately taken by User B2, a new user from the waiting queue. B2 runs until t=6s, at which point B3 takes the slot. Over the 10-second window, the same four "slots" served 8 users (A plus three slot-reuses). Effective throughput roughly doubles.

The critical detail: **new users can join at any forward pass, not just at batch boundaries**. There are no "batch boundaries" in continuous batching. Every forward pass can have a different set of active users than the previous one.

### 14.3: The throughput comparison

![Figure 14.3: Static vs continuous batching: tokens produced per second](figures/ch14-fig3-comparison-timeline/final.png)
*Figure 14.3.* Two line charts sharing an x-axis. Top: "Static batching", cumulative tokens emitted rises steeply for the first 2s (short sequences finishing), then flat from t=2 to t=10 (waiting for the longest), then a big jump at t=10 as everyone exits. Bottom: "Continuous batching", cumulative tokens rises steadily throughout at constant slope. Annotation: "Continuous batching produces tokens at a stable rate; static stalls for most of the window."

Figure 14.3 puts numbers on the difference. Under static batching, most of the window is flat, tokens are not being emitted because the batch is blocked on its slowest member. Under continuous batching, the slope is constant and roughly equal to the batch size × the per-user TPS.

In real production measurements (Kwon et al., 2023, in the vLLM paper), continuous batching over realistic chat workloads delivers 2-4× the tokens per GPU per hour compared to static batching of the same size. On workloads with very heterogeneous output lengths (some users chatting, some generating long code), the factor is closer to 5× or more.

---

## How the Scheduler Actually Works

### 14.4: Iteration-level scheduling

The core abstraction is: **the scheduler runs once per forward pass**. Before every forward pass, the scheduler decides which users' decode/prefill steps will be included. After the forward pass, finished users are evicted and new users admitted.

![Figure 14.4: Iteration-level scheduling inside continuous batching](figures/ch14-fig4-iteration-level-scheduling/final.png)
*Figure 14.4.* A horizontal representation of three consecutive iterations. Iteration 1: batch contains [User A token t=10, User B token t=30, User C prefill chunk 0/3]. Iteration 2: [A t=11, B t=31, C prefill chunk 1/3]. Iteration 3: [A t=12, B finishes (evicted), C prefill chunk 2/3, User E new prefill chunk 0/2]. Annotation: "Batch composition is dynamic. Every forward pass is a fresh scheduling decision."

Figure 14.4 shows the scheduler's view. At each iteration, the batch composition is whatever the scheduler decided this pass. Sequences in decode stage produce one token and stay in the batch. Sequences completing their decode (hit end-of-sequence or max length) are evicted. Sequences in chunked prefill process their next chunk. New users arriving in the waiting queue can be admitted if there is room.

The "room" is governed by two parameters that work together:

* **`max_num_seqs`**: the concurrency cap (how many active sequences fit in the batch).
* **`max_num_batched_tokens`**: the per-step token budget (how many tokens of work can go into one forward pass).

### 14.5: max\_num\_seqs: the concurrency cap

![Figure 14.5: max_num_seqs: the concurrency cap](figures/ch14-fig5-max-num-seqs/final.png)
*Figure 14.5.* A visualization of 32 "batch slots," 28 colored (in use) and 4 white (free). An arrow from the right labeled "Waiting queue: 12 new requests" points at the 4 free slots. Annotation: "4 of 12 can admit; the rest wait. max\_num\_seqs too low = low utilization; too high = OOM on cache."

Figure 14.5 shows the concurrency pool. `max_num_seqs` is the hard cap on how many sequences can be active simultaneously. When a new request arrives and the pool is full, it waits in the admission queue until a slot opens.

Setting `max_num_seqs` is a classic tuning decision:

* **Too low** (say, 8 on an H100 that could handle 40): you underutilize the GPU. System TPS is low, $/M tokens is high.
* **Too high** (say, 100 on the same GPU): you run out of KV cache space. New users get OOM errors or waste HBM bandwidth on thrashing.

The right value depends on (a) how big your model's KV cache is per user (smaller cache = more seats), (b) how much HBM you can devote to cache after weights and workspace are subtracted, and (c) how heterogeneous your workloads are. The vLLM default of 256 is a starting point; production systems usually tune to match their specific model and hardware.

### 14.6: max\_num\_batched\_tokens: the per-step token budget

![Figure 14.6: max_num_batched_tokens: per-step token budget](figures/ch14-fig6-max-num-batched-tokens/final.png)
*Figure 14.6.* A horizontal "budget bar" labeled "max\_num\_batched\_tokens = 4096." Filled segments from left to right: "16 decodes × 1 token = 16 tokens" (tiny). "3 chunked prefills × 1024 tokens = 3072" (big). "Remaining 1008 tokens allocated to a 4th prefill chunk" (medium). "Unused." Annotation: "Scheduler fills the bar up to the limit each step."

Figure 14.6 shows the second parameter. Each forward pass processes a certain total number of tokens, the sum of:

* 1 token per sequence in decode stage (for each active user decoding).
* Up to `chunk_size` tokens per sequence in prefill stage.

`max_num_batched_tokens` caps this sum. If you have 16 active decodes (16 tokens) and a new user in prefill chunk 2/5 (512 tokens) and another in prefill chunk 0/10 (512 tokens), your current forward pass has 1040 tokens of work, well under a budget of 4096.

When new prefill chunks are ready, the scheduler admits them up to the budget. If you have 4096 tokens of budget and 16 decodes already using 16, you can admit up to `(4096 - 16) / chunk_size = ~8` prefill chunks.

The trade-off: smaller budget gives faster per-step wall time (shorter forward pass) but slower overall prefill throughput. Larger budget packs more work per pass (higher throughput) but lengthens the time between decode tokens for any user stuck behind a big pass.

### 14.7: Mixed-mode batches: prefill + decode in the same pass

Under continuous batching, prefills and decodes routinely run in the same forward pass.

![Figure 14.7: Mixed-mode batch: decode + chunked prefill in the same forward pass](figures/ch14-fig7-mixed-batch/final.png)
*Figure 14.7.* A large batch box with 5 user entries stacked inside: "User A: decode (Q for 1 new token)." "User B: decode." "User C: decode." "User D: chunked prefill, chunk 2/5 (512 tokens)." "User E: chunked prefill, chunk 0/10 (512 tokens)." Annotation: "Attention kernel handles both via FlashAttention + PagedAttention. Fast decode + slow prefill ride together without conflict."

Figure 14.7 shows how modern engines handle mixed batches. The attention kernel doesn't care whether a given sequence is in prefill or decode mode, it just processes however many new tokens each sequence brought, using whatever existing cache the sequence has. FlashAttention handles both uniformly. PagedAttention supplies the cache regardless of which mode each sequence is in.

The consequence: prefill-decode contention is no longer a scheduling-level fight. The scheduler just picks a mix of prefill chunks and decodes up to its budget, and the kernel runs them all together. Fast decodes produce one token each; slow prefills advance by one chunk each. No one waits for anyone else in terms of per-forward-pass stalls.

### 14.8: The GPU utilization gain

![Figure 14.8: GPU utilization: static vs continuous](figures/ch14-fig8-utilization-gain/final.png)
*Figure 14.8.* Two vertical bars. Bar 1 "Static batching, average tensor-core utilization = 22%" (short pale lavender). Bar 2 "Continuous batching, average tensor-core utilization = 73%" (tall deep lavender). Annotation: "3.3× higher utilization."

Figure 14.8 shows the production impact. Static batching on a mixed workload typically yields ~20% tensor core utilization (because slots are mostly idle). Continuous batching yields ~70-80% utilization (because slots are immediately refilled).

This 3-4× difference is the reason the same hardware, with the same model, produces 3-4× more tokens per dollar under continuous batching. It is free money, effectively, you change the scheduler and your throughput triples.

### 14.9: Continuous batching requires PagedAttention

A final conceptual point: continuous batching cannot exist without PagedAttention (Chapter 11).

![Figure 14.9: Continuous batching needs PagedAttention (and vice versa)](figures/ch14-fig9-continuous-plus-paged/final.png)
*Figure 14.9.* Two side-by-side panels. Left "Continuous batching requires a flexible KV cache": arrows show sequences entering and leaving the batch at different times, each with variable length, incompatible with contiguous allocation. Right "PagedAttention enables exactly this": block-based KV with non-contiguous per-user blocks; when a sequence ends, its blocks immediately return to the free pool. Annotation: "Co-designed. Neither works alone."

Figure 14.9 shows the dependence. Continuous batching requires the KV cache to expand dynamically (as each user's sequence grows), shrink dynamically (as users finish), and allow new users to join without blocking on fragmentation. Only a paged, block-based cache supports this cleanly. A contiguous-allocation cache would force the scheduler to wait for slots in ways that defeat the purpose of continuous batching.

Conversely, PagedAttention's utility only materializes under continuous batching. If you had a paged cache but still ran static batches, you would not realize the 8× concurrent-user improvement that Chapter 11 promised.

This is why vLLM ships them together and always has. They are two sides of the same coin, the paged cache is what makes the scheduler's flexibility cheap, and the scheduler's flexibility is what makes the paged cache economically meaningful.

## Continuous Batching on the Roofline

### 14.10: Climbing the slope

![Figure 14.10: Continuous batching pushes you up the roofline](figures/ch14-fig10-continuous-on-roofline/final.png)
*Figure 14.10.* The roofline diagram. Three labeled points ascending the slope: "Static batch = 1 (decode)" very low AI. "Continuous batch = 8" higher AI. "Continuous batch = 32" near the ridge. A single curved arrow passing through the three dots labeled "larger effective batch → higher AI." Legend: "Each HBM weight-load amortized across more tokens."

Figure 14.10 is the roofline interpretation. Continuous batching does not reduce the bytes per step (weights are still read). It does not reduce the bytes per token (each user's cache is still read). What it does is **amortize the weight-read across multiple users**, the same 140 GB of Llama-3-70B weights, read once per forward pass, now produces 32 tokens instead of 1. Arithmetic intensity rises by 32×.

This is the mechanism by which continuous batching moves the operating point from deep memory-bound (at batch 1) to close to the ridge (at batch 32). The compute ceiling is the cap; below the ridge, more batch is always better; above the ridge, more batch hurts per-user latency without helping throughput.

The art of tuning `max_num_seqs` and `max_num_batched_tokens` is precisely finding the operating point that sits at the ridge, maximum system TPS without incurring per-user ITL degradation.

### 14.11: What continuous batching does not solve

**Per-user latency at extreme batch.** At very large batches (approaching max\_num\_seqs = 128 or beyond), per-user ITL starts to rise because the forward pass takes longer. Continuous batching doesn't make forward passes faster; it just packs more into each one. There is a trade-off point.

**Tail latency under bursty traffic.** If 100 users arrive simultaneously and max\_num\_seqs = 32, the 68 overflow users queue. This queue wait adds to TTFT. Autoscaling and admission control (Chapter 18) address this.

**Prefill/decode starvation imbalance.** If your workload has very long prefills dominating the token budget, decodes can be starved even with chunked prefill. Disaggregated P/D (Chapter 17) addresses this by putting the two workloads on different GPUs.

### 14.12: Where we go next

Chapter 15 takes the batch amortization idea further: **speculative decoding**. What if, in addition to packing multiple users' tokens per forward pass, we could produce multiple tokens for each user per forward pass? A cheap "draft" model predicts several tokens at a time; the full model verifies them all at once. When the predictions are correct, one forward pass emits multiple tokens per user, effectively multiplying batch amortization even further. This is the final major runtime-layer optimization before we move to infrastructure in Chapter 16.

# Chapter 15: Speculative Decoding

Chapter 14 closed with one of the most important facts in this book: the per-decode-step cost on an H100 for a 7B model is dominated by the 4 ms of HBM traffic needed to read 14 GB of weights. That 4 ms is the physical floor on per-user ITL, and continuous batching's contribution is to spread it across many users. But there is a second, orthogonal trick: what if a single forward pass could emit **multiple tokens for the same user**?

That is **speculative decoding**. The idea, from Leviathan, Kalai, and Matias (2022), is startlingly simple. Use a small, cheap "draft" model to propose a few candidate next tokens. Use the full model to verify them all in one forward pass. When the draft is right, you have emitted multiple user tokens in the wall-clock time of one forward pass of the target. When the draft is wrong, you recover gracefully, the output is guaranteed to be identical to what the target model alone would have produced.

This is a free speedup. Not "almost free with a minor quality regression", actually free. The output distribution of speculative decoding is mathematically identical to the output distribution of vanilla target-model decoding. The only cost is the draft model (small) and some scheduling overhead (tiny). The reward, for most workloads, is a 2-3× wall-clock speedup on decode.

This chapter walks through the three major implementations, n-gram matching, EAGLE, and Medusa, derives why the accept/reject rule preserves the target distribution exactly, and explains when speculation helps versus when it does not.

## The Decode Problem, Once More

### 15.1: Why decode is expensive in a way batching alone cannot fix

Continuous batching amortizes the per-forward-pass weight-load across users. That is a win, but it has a ceiling, `max_num_seqs` is typically 32-128, beyond which per-user ITL degrades.

![Figure 15.1: Why decode is brutal: load 14 GB, use for 1 token](figures/ch15-fig1-decode-bottleneck/final.png)
*Figure 15.1.* A fat HBM bar labeled "Llama-3 7B weights = 14 GB." An arrow labeled "load all weights from HBM each forward pass, ~4 ms." A tiny output labeled "1 new token (~7 bytes)." Annotation: "GPU spends 4 ms loading weights and ~30 μs computing. ~99% loading, ~1% computing."

Figure 15.1 shows the asymmetry. For a single user, a single decode step loads 14 GB of weights from HBM (4 ms of pure data movement) and then does about 14 GFLOPs of compute (which on H100's 989 TFLOPS FP16 tensor cores takes ~14 μs). The GPU spends 99.7% of the decode step idle, waiting for bytes to arrive.

Speculation attacks this directly. If the same 4 ms weight-load could produce *k* verified tokens for the user instead of 1, per-user TPS multiplies by k. The wall-clock cost is the same; the output rate is k×.

---

## How Speculation Works

### 15.2: The three-stage pipeline

![Figure 15.2: Speculative decoding: draft, verify, accept](figures/ch15-fig2-spec-decoding-pipeline/final.png)
*Figure 15.2.* A horizontal pipeline of four boxes. (1) "Draft model (e.g., 1B params), generates K candidate tokens cheaply." (2) "Target model (7B), verifies ALL K tokens in ONE forward pass." (3) "Accept/Reject: compare each candidate's target-model probability to draft's." (4) "Commit accepted tokens to output; discard rejected." A numeric example underneath: draft produces 'The cat is on the mat'; target verifies; all 6 tokens approved; 6 tokens emitted in the time of 1 target forward pass.

Figure 15.2 shows the pipeline.

**Stage 1, Draft.** A small, fast model proposes the next K tokens (typically K=4-8). The draft model's forward passes are cheap, a 1B-parameter draft runs in a few hundred microseconds per token. So K tokens of drafting take ~1-4 ms total.

**Stage 2, Verify.** The target (full) model runs a single forward pass on the entire K-token candidate sequence. This forward pass produces target-model probabilities for each of the K positions. Because we are running one forward pass on K tokens rather than K forward passes on one token each, we only pay one weight-load, the same 4 ms we would have paid to produce one token.

**Stage 3, Accept/Reject.** For each of the K draft tokens, decide whether the target model "would have" chosen it. Accept the ones it would have; reject the first one it would not have.

### 15.3: The accept/reject rule

The core math: how do we decide whether to accept a draft token?

Let `p_target(x)` be the target model's probability for token x, and `p_draft(x)` be the draft model's probability for the same x. The rule is:

* If `p_target(x) >= p_draft(x)` → **Always accept** the draft.
* If `p_target(x) < p_draft(x)` → **Accept with probability** `p_target(x) / p_draft(x)`.
* If we **reject**, we resample from an **adjusted distribution**: `max(0, p_target - p_draft)`, renormalized to sum to 1.

![Figure 15.3: The accept/reject rule preserves the target distribution](figures/ch15-fig3-accept-reject-math/final.png)
*Figure 15.3.* A 2-row rule table. Row 1 "If p\_target(x) >= p\_draft(x) → ACCEPT with probability 1." Row 2 "If p\_target(x) < p\_draft(x) → ACCEPT with probability p\_target/p\_draft." Row 3 (rejection branch): "If REJECTED, resample from max(0, p\_target - p\_draft), normalized." Annotation underneath: "By construction, final accepted token is distributed exactly as target-model-alone."

Figure 15.3 states the rule. The mathematical claim: under this rule, the distribution of accepted tokens, marginalized over the draft's choices, is exactly equal to the target model's distribution.

**Proof sketch.** For any particular output token `x`, the probability that the algorithm emits `x` is the sum of two disjoint events:
1. The draft proposed `x` and we accepted, with probability `p_draft(x) · min(1, p_target(x)/p_draft(x)) = min(p_draft(x), p_target(x))`.
2. We rejected whatever the draft proposed and resampled `x` from the residual distribution.

The second event's probability works out so that the total probability of emitting `x` equals `p_target(x)` exactly. This is the content of the original Leviathan et al. 2023 paper, Theorem 1.

The practical consequence: **speculative decoding is a free speedup**. The output is statistically indistinguishable from what the target model would have produced alone. Users cannot tell any difference. Only the wall-clock time changes.

### 15.3.1: A worked numerical walkthrough

The accept/reject rule is easy to state and hard to feel. Let us run it end-to-end on four tokens with real numbers. This is the same kind of trace you would see in a debugger if you stepped through a real speculative-decoding kernel.

**Setup.** The prompt so far is `"The weather today is"`. The draft model proposes K = 4 next tokens:

```
draft tokens   =  [  "is",   "a",   "beautiful",   "day"  ]
position       =     t+1     t+2        t+3         t+4
```

The target model runs a single forward pass on the prompt concatenated with all 4 draft tokens. That one pass produces a probability distribution at every position. For each of the 4 draft positions, we now have:

* `p_target[i]` — the target model's probability for the draft token at position i
* `p_draft[i]` — the draft model's probability for that same token (recorded when the draft proposed it)

Assume the following numbers come back from the forward pass:

| Position | Draft token | p\_draft | p\_target | Ratio p\_t / p\_d |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| t+1 | "is" | 0.65 | 0.72 | 1.108 |
| t+2 | "a" | 0.50 | 0.58 | 1.160 |
| t+3 | "beautiful" | 0.30 | 0.08 | 0.267 |
| t+4 | "day" | 0.40 | 0.20 | 0.500 |

![Figure 15.3.1: Accept/reject trace as a matrix](figures/ch15-fig3-1-accept-reject-matrix-trace/final.png)
*Figure 15.3.1.* A 4-row × 6-column matrix. Rows are positions t+1 through t+4. Columns: "Draft token", "p\_draft", "p\_target", "α = min(1, p\_t/p\_d)", "r ~ U(0,1)", "Decision". Cells filled with the values from the table above plus random draws r = 0.12, 0.44, 0.61, — (not sampled after reject). Row t+1 and t+2 highlighted green (ACCEPT). Row t+3 highlighted red (REJECT). Row t+4 greyed out (unreached). An arrow at the bottom: "After first reject at t+3, resample from max(0, p\_target − p\_draft), normalized."

Figure 15.3.1 is the whole algorithm in one matrix. The accept/reject pass reads rows top-to-bottom and stops at the first red row.

**Position t+1, draft token "is".**
- `α = min(1, 0.72 / 0.65) = min(1, 1.108) = 1.0`
- Draw `r ~ U(0, 1)`, say `r = 0.12`. Check `r < α`? `0.12 < 1.0` → yes.
- **ACCEPT.** Running output: `["is"]`.

Intuition: the target model likes `"is"` *more* than the draft did (0.72 vs 0.65). The draft did not bias us toward something the target dislikes. No reason to reject.

**Position t+2, draft token "a".**
- `α = min(1, 0.58 / 0.50) = min(1, 1.160) = 1.0`
- Draw `r = 0.44`. `0.44 < 1.0` → yes.
- **ACCEPT.** Running output: `["is", "a"]`.

Same reasoning. The draft's distribution under-weighted `"a"` relative to the target, so the target is happy with the choice.

**Position t+3, draft token "beautiful".**
- `α = min(1, 0.08 / 0.30) = min(1, 0.267) = 0.267`
- Draw `r = 0.61`. `0.61 < 0.267` → no.
- **REJECT.** We stop verifying. Position t+4 is not even examined.

Intuition: the draft was confident in `"beautiful"` (p\_draft = 0.30) but the target is not (p\_target = 0.08). The draft is pulling us toward a token the target thinks is unlikely. We accept with probability equal to the *ratio* — here 26.7% — and reject otherwise. The random draw of 0.61 lands in the reject region.

**Rejection resampling.** When we reject at position t+3, we do not simply output nothing. We resample one corrected token from a *rebalanced distribution* that subtracts off the draft's bias:

```
p_rebalanced(t) = max(0, p_target(t) - p_draft(t)) / Z
```

where `Z` is the normalization constant so the distribution sums to 1. Concretely, at position t+3 suppose the target model's full distribution over the top few candidates is:

| Token | p\_target | p\_draft | max(0, p\_t − p\_d) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| "sunny" | 0.45 | 0.10 | 0.35 |
| "warm" | 0.22 | 0.08 | 0.14 |
| "beautiful" | 0.08 | 0.30 | 0.00 (clipped) |
| "cloudy" | 0.15 | 0.12 | 0.03 |
| "nice" | 0.10 | 0.40 | 0.00 (clipped) |
| other | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 |

The unnormalized residual sums to `0.35 + 0.14 + 0.00 + 0.03 + 0.00 = 0.52`, so `Z = 0.52`. The rebalanced distribution becomes:

```
p_rebalanced =  [ "sunny": 0.673,  "warm": 0.269,  "cloudy": 0.058, ... ]
```

Sampling from this, we draw `"sunny"` with 67.3% probability. It is exactly the token the target model preferred most strongly *after removing the portion of probability mass the draft model had already consumed*.

**Final output of this verification step:** `["is", "a", "sunny"]` — three tokens emitted from *one* target-model forward pass (plus the cheap drafting pass). Without speculation, the target would have needed 3 forward passes to produce these same 3 tokens. Roughly a 3× speedup for this step.

### 15.3.2: Why the rebalancing preserves the target distribution

The subtraction-and-clip in `max(0, p_target − p_draft)` is not a heuristic. It is exactly what the math demands for the final output distribution to equal `p_target`.

Consider the probability that the algorithm outputs a specific token `x` at some position. Two disjoint paths lead to `x` being emitted:

1. **Path A: draft proposed x and we accepted.** Probability = `p_draft(x) · min(1, p_target(x) / p_draft(x)) = min(p_draft(x), p_target(x))`.
2. **Path B: draft proposed some y ≠ x, we rejected y, then we resampled x from the rebalanced distribution.** Probability = `P(reject) · p_rebalanced(x)`.

Summing A + B must equal `p_target(x)` exactly for the output distribution to be identical to target-model-alone decoding. Working through the algebra (this is Theorem 1 of Leviathan et al. 2023):

```
P(output = x)  =  min(p_draft(x), p_target(x))                          [path A]
              +  P(reject) · max(0, p_target(x) - p_draft(x)) / Z       [path B]
              =  p_target(x)                                             [exact]
```

The `max(0, ...)` is what makes the residual a valid probability distribution (no negative values). The `/ Z` normalizes. Together they make path B's contribution exactly the "missing probability" that path A could not deliver. No approximation. The output is statistically identical to target-model-alone decoding; only the wall-clock cost changes.

![Figure 15.3.2: Two paths to emit token x, summed give p_target(x)](figures/ch15-fig3-2-two-paths-proof/final.png)
*Figure 15.3.2.* A two-column bar visualization. Left column, "If draft proposed x": bar height min(p\_draft(x), p\_target(x)). Right column, "If draft proposed something else and we resampled": bar height P(reject) · max(0, p\_t − p\_d)/Z. A plus sign between them, and the sum exactly equals a single reference bar labeled "p\_target(x)." Annotation: "The rebalancing term is precisely the missing mass."

### 15.4: Three ways to produce the draft

The algorithm is agnostic about where the draft tokens come from. Three major approaches have emerged.

#### 15.4.1: N-gram matching

The cheapest approach. Look at the last n tokens of the context, search earlier in the context for the same n-gram, and propose the continuation that appeared last time.

![Figure 15.4: N-gram speculative decoding](figures/ch15-fig4-ngram-method/final.png)
*Figure 15.4.* Example scenario. Prompt so far: "The cat sat on the mat. The cat sat on the." Last 3 tokens: "The cat sat." Search history for "The cat sat" → found earlier → predicts next 3 tokens: "on the mat." Visual: two horizontal strips of tokens, the matching "The cat sat" highlighted in both occurrences. Annotation: "Zero model needed. Just a rolling hash. Works best for repetitive structured outputs (code, JSON, SQL)."

Figure 15.4 shows the idea. No draft model at all, the "draft" is just a lookup into the input's own history.

This is shockingly effective for structured outputs. When you ask an LLM to generate JSON, it tends to repeat patterns ("field: value, field: value, ..."). N-gram speculation gets these right nearly every time and emits them nearly for free. Same for code generation (repeated variable names, bracket patterns) and for long coherent prose that re-uses phrases.

For conversational workloads where output is less repetitive, n-gram speculation is less effective, typical acceptance rate ~30%, giving ~1.5× speedup. Still free; still worth turning on.

#### 15.4.2: EAGLE

EAGLE (Li et al., 2024) is the current state-of-the-art learned draft. Instead of a separate small model, it trains a **tiny feed-forward head** that sits on top of the target model and predicts future tokens from the target's own hidden states.

![Figure 15.5: EAGLE: a tiny draft head on top of the target's hidden states](figures/ch15-fig5-eagle-method/final.png)
*Figure 15.5.* A diagram showing the target model's last transformer layer producing a hidden state h. A small 1-layer feed-forward head (the EAGLE head) takes h as input and autoregressively predicts the next 3 candidate tokens. These candidates are fed to the full target model for verification. Side annotation: "EAGLE trains on the target's own hidden states. High acceptance rate (60-80%) at low draft cost."

Figure 15.5 shows the architecture. The key insight: the target model's hidden state `h` at position `t` already contains most of the information needed to predict position `t+1`. A small head can extract that prediction cheaply. For `t+2` and beyond, the head runs autoregressively on its own previous output, accumulating prediction error, but still accurate enough to be useful.

EAGLE achieves 60-80% acceptance rate in practice, giving 2.5-3.5× speedup. It is the technique TensorRT-LLM ships with for speculative decoding, and vLLM's ecosystem now supports it as well.

#### 15.4.3: Medusa

Medusa (Cai et al., 2024) takes a different approach: **multiple parallel heads** on top of the target model, each predicting a specific future position.

![Figure 15.6: Medusa: multiple parallel prediction heads](figures/ch15-fig6-medusa-method/final.png)
*Figure 15.6.* The target model's last hidden state h. Below, 4 parallel "Medusa heads" drawn as 4 small boxes. Head 1 predicts t+1; Head 2 predicts t+2; Head 3 predicts t+3; Head 4 predicts t+4. All 4 heads run in parallel in one forward pass of the heads. An arrow right: "Target model verifies all 4 candidates in 1 big forward pass." Annotation: "Unlike EAGLE, Medusa predicts non-autoregressively. Higher throughput but slightly lower acceptance."

Figure 15.6 shows Medusa. Instead of running one head autoregressively to produce 4 candidates, Medusa runs 4 heads in parallel, each specialized for one future position. Because they don't depend on each other, they can run in a single forward pass.

The trade-off: Medusa's heads are structurally simpler (they don't get to see prior head predictions), so acceptance rate is a bit lower, typically 50-70%. But each speculation step is cheaper than EAGLE's, so the effective throughput is comparable. It is the simplest approach to implement from scratch.

### 15.5: Acceptance rate determines speedup

![Figure 15.7: Acceptance rate → effective speedup](figures/ch15-fig7-acceptance-rate-curve/final.png)
*Figure 15.7.* A rising curve. X-axis: acceptance rate 0 to 1. Y-axis: effective speedup over vanilla decode from 1× to 5×. Three labeled points: "N-gram (acc=0.3) → 1.6×." "Medusa (acc=0.55) → 2.2×." "EAGLE (acc=0.75) → 3.1×." Annotation: "Every 10 percentage points of acceptance is worth ~30% more speedup."

Figure 15.7 plots the relationship. The formula, roughly, is:

```
speedup ≈ (1 + α + α² + ... + α^K) / (1 + draft_cost_fraction)
```

where α is the per-token acceptance probability and K is the proposal window. Higher acceptance means the chain of accepted tokens extends further on average.

**Worked example.** Plug in concrete numbers for each of the three draft methods at K = 4 and draft cost fraction of 0.05 (draft is ~5% the cost of one target forward pass):

| Method | α | 1 + α + α² + α³ + α⁴ | Numerator | Denominator | Speedup |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| n-gram | 0.30 | 1 + 0.30 + 0.09 + 0.027 + 0.008 | 1.426 | 1.05 | **1.36×** |
| Medusa | 0.55 | 1 + 0.55 + 0.303 + 0.166 + 0.092 | 2.111 | 1.05 | **2.01×** |
| EAGLE | 0.75 | 1 + 0.75 + 0.563 + 0.422 + 0.316 | 3.051 | 1.05 | **2.91×** |

Notice the geometric-series structure. Every extra 10 percentage points of acceptance adds another *compounding* term to the numerator, because to accept token k you must first have accepted tokens 1..k−1. The jump from α = 0.55 to α = 0.75 (20 pp) boosts speedup from 2.01× to 2.91× — nearly 45% more. The relationship is distinctly super-linear in α.

The takeaway: invest in a good draft. An EAGLE-grade head with 75% acceptance is worth dramatically more than an n-gram lookup with 30% acceptance.

### 15.6: Quality is preserved

![Figure 15.8: Quality is identical, speed is not](figures/ch15-fig8-quality-preservation/final.png)
*Figure 15.8.* Two text outputs side by side. Left "Vanilla decode (~50 tok/s)": a paragraph about quicksort. Right "Speculative decode, EAGLE (~150 tok/s)": identical paragraph. A big green checkmark between them labeled "Outputs are mathematically equivalent."

Figure 15.8 reinforces the point from §15.3. The accept/reject rule mathematically preserves the target distribution. The outputs are identical, not approximately identical, literally identical in distribution.

This is what makes speculation worth deploying by default. Other techniques in this book involve trade-offs (quantization has a tiny quality cost, MLA has a tiny quality cost). Speculation has none. If your draft model is fast enough to make the math work, speculation is strictly better.

### 15.7: When speculation helps and when it does not

![Figure 15.9: When speculative decoding helps vs does not](figures/ch15-fig9-when-spec-wins/final.png)
*Figure 15.9.* A 2×2 grid. Top-left: "Long predictable outputs (code, JSON, SQL)", WINS BIG, speedup 2.5-4×. Top-right: "Short creative outputs (chat replies, poetry)", LIGHT WINS, 1.2-1.5×. Bottom-left: "Highly uncertain outputs (high-temperature creative)", LITTLE WIN, 1.0-1.1×. Bottom-right: "Single-shot classification/ranking", NO WIN, not enough tokens. Annotation: "Speculation requires predictable next-token distributions."

Figure 15.9 maps it out.

**Best case, predictable outputs.** Code, structured JSON, SQL, repeated prose patterns. The target model's next-token distribution is usually sharp (one clearly best next token), and the draft can predict it easily. Acceptance rates above 70% are typical. Speedup 2.5-4×.

**Moderate case, everyday chat.** A chat assistant's reply has more lexical variety but still many predictable phrases. Acceptance ~50-60%. Speedup 1.5-2×.

**Weak case, high-temperature creative generation.** When temperature is high, the target distribution is near-uniform over many tokens; the draft cannot reliably match. Speedup barely above 1×.

**No benefit, single-shot outputs.** Classification or ranking outputs are one token. Speculation's setup cost is not amortized. Just decode normally.

### 15.8: Speculation on the roofline

![Figure 15.10: Speculative decoding on the roofline](figures/ch15-fig10-spec-on-roofline/final.png)
*Figure 15.10.* The standard roofline. Two dots: "Vanilla decode" low on slope (AI = 1). "Speculative decode" to the right (AI = K, where K is the accept chain length). A single clean arrow from first to second: "K tokens amortize one HBM weight-load → AI rises by factor K." Annotation: "Without hitting compute ceiling, ~3× speedup from K=4 tokens per pass."

Figure 15.10 shows the roofline interpretation. Each verification forward pass processes multiple candidate tokens on the target model, one weight-load produces K useful token verifications instead of 1. Arithmetic intensity rises by K. The operating point moves right.

Combined with continuous batching (Chapter 14), which amortizes across *users*, speculation amortizes across *tokens*. They multiply. A decode batch of 32 users with a 3-token speculation chain effectively gets 96 tokens per forward pass, nearly 100× more useful work per HBM weight-load than the naive one-user-one-token baseline.

## The Runtime Layer, Completed

### 15.9: What we have built across Chapters 7-15

Nine chapters of runtime-layer optimizations. Let us count the multiplicative speedup over the naive baseline.

* Chapter 7 (KV cache): ~N×, roughly 1000× at N = 4K.
* Chapter 8 (GQA/MLA): 4-8× fewer cache bytes per token → proportional ITL improvement.
* Chapter 9 (sliding window, SSM): when applicable, further cache reductions.
* Chapter 10 (FlashAttention): ~1.5-2× end-to-end speedup.
* Chapter 11 (PagedAttention): 8× concurrent-user capacity → 8× system TPS.
* Chapter 12 (prefix caching + chunked prefill): ~5× TTFT reduction, flat P99 ITL.
* Chapter 13 (quantization): ~2.5× throughput (FP8) or ~4× (INT4).
* Chapter 14 (continuous batching): ~3× system TPS vs static batching.
* Chapter 15 (speculative decoding): ~2-3× per-user decode speedup.

Stacked multiplicatively, these chapters take a naive serving stack from ~10 tokens/sec per GPU to ~1,000-3,000 tokens/sec per GPU at batch 32, two to three orders of magnitude of engineering. This is what separates a production LLM service from a toy implementation.

And we have not yet touched infrastructure. The next three chapters (16-18) show how to scale beyond a single GPU, parallelism, disaggregation, and deployment. That layer multiplies yet again.

### 15.10: Where we go next

Chapter 16 is **parallelism**. When a single GPU is no longer enough, either because the model doesn't fit or because the concurrent-user load exceeds one GPU's ceiling, we distribute the work across multiple GPUs. Tensor parallelism, pipeline parallelism, expert parallelism, sequence parallelism, context parallelism, five dimensions of slicing, each with its own communication pattern and its own constraint. The runtime layer's techniques still apply inside each parallel shard; infrastructure adds a new orthogonal dimension to optimize.

# Chapter 16: Parallelism on the Roofline

Chapters 7 through 15 squeezed every drop of performance out of one GPU. That ceiling, for a well-tuned production stack, is typically 2,000-5,000 tokens per second serving a 7-70B model at batch 32 on an H100. Below a ceiling, every additional user you add increases throughput; above it, per-user latency degrades. And for some models, a single GPU is not an option, Llama-3-70B at FP16 is 140 GB of weights, and no single H100 has that much HBM.

When one GPU is not enough, we go parallel. **Parallelism** is the infrastructure-layer technique for distributing a single inference workload across multiple GPUs. There are five major dimensions along which you can slice a model, each with its own communication pattern, its own hardware requirements, and its own inference applicability. This chapter covers all five, in the order you typically encounter them: tensor parallelism, pipeline parallelism, expert parallelism, sequence parallelism, and context parallelism.

Some of these techniques come from training. At inference they play different roles, some dominate, some are rarely used. We will be careful to distinguish "this is how it works in training" from "this is how it applies at inference" because the same technique can look very different when you are not computing gradients.

This chapter is long because each parallelism dimension has genuine conceptual content, and because the composition of two or three dimensions together is how real production deployments of 70B+ models work.

---

## Why Parallelism Is an Infrastructure Problem

### 16.1: One GPU, then many

Chapter 6 introduced the hardware topology. A production cluster is a set of **nodes**, each node typically holding 8 GPUs connected by NVLink at ~900 GB/s. Nodes are connected to each other by InfiniBand at ~50 GB/s. The 18:1 bandwidth gap between intra-node and inter-node communication is the single most important architectural constraint for parallelism.

Figure 16.1 shows the data-parallel case, which is the baseline for thinking about multi-GPU deployment.

![Figure 16.1: Data parallelism: every GPU has the full model](figures/ch16-fig1-data-parallelism-baseline/final.png)
*Figure 16.1.* Four GPU boxes in a row, each labeled GPU 0 through 3. Each GPU holds a complete copy of the model (labeled "Llama-3 70B, 140 GB"). Four different input batch shards sit above the four GPUs: "Batch shard A" through "Batch shard D." Annotation: "No communication during forward pass. Training: all-reduce gradients. Inference: each replica is independent."

Figure 16.1 is data parallelism, the simplest form of multi-GPU. Each GPU gets a full model copy and a different slice of the input batch. For training, the four GPUs sync gradients after each step via an AllReduce. For inference, there is no sync at all, each GPU runs its shard independently.

**Inference-wise, data parallelism is equivalent to running N independent serving replicas.** It gives you N× throughput but no extra model capacity per replica, no KV cache sharing, no way to serve a model that doesn't fit on one GPU. It is what we call "replication" in Chapter 18, and while essential, it is not what most people mean when they say "parallelism."

The interesting cases are the four below, where a single model runs split across multiple GPUs. These are the infrastructure-layer techniques that make large models and long contexts feasible.

---

## Four Sharding Strategies

### 16.2: Tensor parallelism

**Tensor parallelism (TP)** splits each layer's matrix multiplications across GPUs. Every GPU holds a slice of every weight matrix; every forward pass reads its own slice and contributes a partial result.

![Figure 16.2: Tensor parallelism: split a matmul column-wise](figures/ch16-fig2-tensor-parallelism/final.png)
*Figure 16.2.* A big weight matrix W of shape (d\_in, d\_out) drawn as a wide rectangle. It is split into 4 vertical stripes, each labeled "W[shard 0]" through "W[shard 3]," one per GPU (color-coded). Input X of shape (batch, d\_in) is replicated to all 4 GPUs. Each GPU computes its partial output Y\_shard = X · W[shard]. Annotation: "Outputs concatenated. Next matmul needs an AllReduce."

Figure 16.2 shows the basic TP partition. A weight matrix W is split into vertical stripes. GPU *i* holds stripe *i*. Input X is broadcast to all GPUs. Each GPU computes its partial matmul. The shards' output pieces are concatenated (via a Gather) or summed (AllReduce) to produce the full output.

The communication pattern depends on the shape:

* **Column parallelism** (as in Figure 16.2): W is split along its output dimension. Output is concatenated. No communication at that matmul, communication happens at the *next* matmul's input.
* **Row parallelism**: W is split along its input dimension. Each GPU must have only the relevant rows of input. Output is an AllReduce across GPUs.

In practice, transformer layers are designed so that consecutive matmuls use alternating patterns: column-parallel Q/K/V projections followed by row-parallel output projection, producing a single AllReduce per attention layer. Similarly for FFN: column-parallel up-projection followed by row-parallel down-projection.

![Figure 16.3: Tensor parallelism needs an AllReduce after each block](figures/ch16-fig3-tp-allreduce/final.png)
*Figure 16.3.* Four GPU boxes. For one transformer block: input X replicated. Q, K, V columns split across GPUs (each GPU computes partial attention). Output projection (row-split) produces partial output per GPU. An "AllReduce (SUM)" ring connects all 4 GPUs. Same pattern for the MLP. Annotation: "One AllReduce per attention, one per MLP. Per-layer overhead."

Figure 16.3 shows the per-layer pattern. Two AllReduces per transformer block, one after attention, one after MLP. For a 80-layer model: 160 AllReduces per forward pass.

AllReduce is expensive. On NVLink at 900 GB/s, moving a 32 MB activation tensor (typical for large models at batch 32) takes about 36 μs. At 160 AllReduces per forward pass, that is ~5.7 ms of pure communication per forward pass per decode step.

At 50 GB/s over InfiniBand (cross-node), the same AllReduce takes 640 μs, and 160 of them total ~100 ms per forward pass. That is **devastating** for interactive serving, a 100 ms communication overhead makes TTFT and ITL unacceptable.

**Rule: tensor parallelism MUST stay inside one node.** The NVLink bandwidth is just enough to absorb the AllReduce cost at modest TP degree (2, 4, 8). Crossing to InfiniBand turns the optimization into a regression.

#### 16.2.1: Degree and sharding

Typical TP degrees are 2, 4, or 8. Llama-3-70B is usually served with TP=8 (one node of 8 H100s). A Llama-3-8B can run with TP=1 (one GPU) or TP=2 if you want more compute headroom. TP=16 (two nodes) is rarely used because of the InfiniBand bottleneck.

At TP=8, the model's weight matrices are partitioned 8 ways. Each GPU holds 1/8 of each matrix. Activations and KV cache are also partitioned, each GPU holds the slices corresponding to its Q/K/V heads.

### 16.3: Pipeline parallelism

**Pipeline parallelism (PP)** splits the model along its depth (number of layers), not its width (matrix dimensions). GPU 0 holds layers 1-20; GPU 1 holds layers 21-40; and so on. Activations flow from GPU 0 to GPU 1 to GPU 2 to GPU 3, with each stage processing its chunk of layers.

![Figure 16.4: Pipeline parallelism: different layer groups on different GPUs](figures/ch16-fig4-pipeline-parallelism/final.png)
*Figure 16.4.* Four GPUs in a row, each holding a contiguous chunk of the model: GPU 0 with layers 1-20; GPU 1 with layers 21-40; GPU 2 with layers 41-60; GPU 3 with layers 61-80. An arrow flow: Input → GPU 0 → GPU 1 → GPU 2 → GPU 3 → Output. Each inter-GPU arrow is labeled "activation transfer, ~few MB per token." Annotation: "Pipeline parallelism CAN cross nodes (InfiniBand) because activations are small."

Figure 16.4 shows PP. The communication is between stages: each GPU sends its output activations to the next GPU. These activations are **small**, a 7B model at batch 32 and seq length 2048 has activations of shape (32, 2048, 4096) = 256 MB in FP16, and only a fraction of that crosses between stages per forward pass.

Because activations are small, PP works over InfiniBand. Cross-node pipelines are viable. At 50 GB/s, transferring 8 MB per stage takes ~160 μs, acceptable even at many stages.

#### 16.3.1: The pipeline bubble problem

Pipelines have a classic efficiency problem: when you feed a sequence of inputs through, the first stage finishes a microbatch before the last stage has started. At steady state, all stages are working, but the fill and drain phases leave GPUs idle.

![Figure 16.5: The pipeline bubble problem](figures/ch16-fig5-pipeline-bubble/final.png)
*Figure 16.5.* A Gantt chart. Four rows (one per GPU stage). Time on the x-axis. Naive schedule: at t=0, only GPU 0 working. At t=1, GPU 0+1 working. At t=3, all four. Then at the end: GPU 0 finishes first, idle; GPU 1 finishes next, idle; etc. The idle "bubble" periods shaded in grey. Annotation: "Each GPU idle ~25% of the time in naive schedule."

Figure 16.5 shows the bubble. In a naive 4-stage pipeline with 4 microbatches, each stage is idle for 25% of the time on either side of the steady state.

Remedies exist: **microbatching** (break the input batch into many small microbatches, so the steady state dominates), **1F1B scheduling** (interleave forward and backward passes), **chimera schedules** (simultaneously running forward pipelines from both ends). For training, these matter a lot and there is a rich literature.

For inference, pipeline bubbles are **small** in practice because inference doesn't have a backward pass, so the pipeline is shorter per token. Many modern inference stacks avoid PP entirely for small-to-medium models and only turn it on when the model genuinely does not fit any other way.

#### 16.3.2: When to use PP

Pipeline parallelism is the right answer when:

* **The model is too large to fit in a single node via TP alone.** A 405B-parameter model at FP16 is 810 GB. Even 8 × 80 GB GPUs (640 GB) does not fit. You either quantize to fit in one node, or you use PP to span two nodes.
* **Your model has high latency requirements and the compute is more uniform across layers than across a single matmul.** Certain model architectures can benefit; Llama variants generally do not.

PP is less common in inference than in training. The base pattern for 70B-class models is TP=8 (inside a node) with no PP; for ultra-large models, TP=8 × PP=2 (spanning two nodes) or similar compositions.

### 16.4: Expert parallelism

**Expert parallelism (EP)** applies to mixture-of-experts (MoE) models. In an MoE, each FFN layer has multiple "expert" sub-networks, and a learned router selects a subset (typically 2 of 8 or 2 of 64) for each token. Expert parallelism distributes experts across GPUs, GPU *i* holds experts `[i·E/N, (i+1)·E/N]`.

![Figure 16.6: Expert parallelism: MoE routing across GPUs](figures/ch16-fig6-expert-parallelism/final.png)
*Figure 16.6.* A central MoE layer with 8 experts drawn as 8 boxes. Four GPUs below, each holding 2 of the 8 experts: GPU 0 has Experts 0,1; GPU 1 has Experts 2,3; GPU 2 has Experts 4,5; GPU 3 has Experts 6,7. At the top, a "Router" box routes each token to its top-K experts. Arrows show tokens being dispatched to assigned experts across GPUs.

Figure 16.6 shows EP. At runtime, the router picks the top-K experts for each token. The tokens are "shuffled" across GPUs, each token goes to wherever its assigned experts live. After the experts compute, the outputs are shuffled back.

Two all-to-all communications per MoE layer: one for dispatch (tokens to experts), one for combine (expert outputs back to source GPUs). These are significant but much smaller than TP's AllReduce because only the top-K experts' inputs/outputs need to move, not the full activation.

EP shines for very large MoE models. DeepSeek-V3 has 256 experts with top-8 routing; it is impossible to fit on one node without EP. It is typically composed with TP: experts themselves are tensor-parallel inside a node, with EP spanning across nodes. DeepSeek-V3's standard deployment is EP=16 × TP=2.

For dense (non-MoE) models, EP does not apply.

### 16.5: Sequence parallelism and context parallelism

Two variants worth naming briefly.

**Sequence parallelism (SP)** splits tokens across GPUs for the parts of the forward pass that don't need cross-token information: LayerNorm, Dropout, residual additions. Each GPU handles a subset of tokens locally. For parts that need cross-token info (attention), sequence is AllGathered temporarily. SP doesn't reduce the attention cost but reduces memory for non-attention operations. Used in Megatron-LM and some production stacks.

**Context parallelism (CP)** splits the sequence axis for the attention computation itself. At very long contexts (100K+ tokens), a single GPU cannot hold the KV cache; CP splits it across GPUs, with each GPU holding a range of token positions. Attention then becomes a "ring" computation where K and V chunks rotate between GPUs.

![Figure 16.7: Sequence parallelism](figures/ch16-fig7-sequence-parallelism/final.png)
*Figure 16.7.* A sequence of 32 tokens split into 4 equal segments of 8, each assigned to one of 4 GPUs (color-coded). Annotation: "Each GPU processes its segment locally for LayerNorm and Dropout. Attention uses AllGather." Right side: an AllGather operation pulling all segments to each GPU for attention.

![Figure 16.8: Context parallelism](figures/ch16-fig8-context-parallelism/final.png)
*Figure 16.8.* A very long 128K-token sequence split into 8 chunks of 16K each, assigned to 8 GPUs. A "Ring" communication pattern: each GPU computes local Q-K scores, then passes its K/V chunk to the next GPU in the ring, repeating until all Q's have seen all K/V. Annotation: "Context parallelism enables sequences that don't fit on one GPU."

Figures 16.7 and 16.8 show SP and CP. Both are more specialized than TP/PP/EP and are typically added on top of the other parallelism dimensions when specific constraints (memory, context length) demand them.

### 16.6: Which parallelism for which workload?

![Figure 16.9: Parallelism strategy matrix](figures/ch16-fig9-parallelism-strategy-matrix/final.png)
*Figure 16.9.* A 5-row, 4-column table. Columns: "Training," "Small-model inference," "Big-model inference," "Long-context inference." Rows: DP (training primary, small inference = replication, NOT for big, NOT for long). TP (training intra-node, not-small, big-model primary, works for long). PP (training cross-node, not-small, big-model primary with TP, works for long). EP (training MoE, big MoE inference). CP (not training, not small, works big-long, primary for long).

Figure 16.9 is the decision matrix. Reading across the "big-model inference" column: your first choice is tensor parallelism intra-node. If the model still doesn't fit (say, 405B with no quantization), add pipeline parallelism to span nodes. If it is an MoE, use expert parallelism on top. For long context, add context parallelism.

A typical production setup for a 70B dense model is: **TP=8 intra-node, one node per replica, multiple replicas for scale**. No PP, no EP, no CP needed.

For DeepSeek-V3 (671B MoE): **TP=2 intra-node × EP=16 across nodes**. This is the largest realistic parallelism dimension for frontier models.

For Llama-3-405B dense: **TP=8 × PP=2 across two nodes**. The PP is forced by the model size.

### 16.7: Parallelism on the roofline

![Figure 16.10: Parallelism raises per-GPU arithmetic intensity](figures/ch16-fig10-parallelism-on-roofline/final.png)
*Figure 16.10.* The roofline. Two labeled points: "1 GPU, full Llama-3-70B in HBM, small batch" (memory-bound, low AI). "4-way TP, same model" (higher AI per GPU). Arrow from first to second: "TP amortizes weight-loads, higher AI per GPU."

Figure 16.10 is the roofline interpretation. Each GPU in a TP=4 setup holds only 1/4 of the weights. Per forward pass per GPU, only 1/4 of the original weights are loaded. But the batch is the same, all 4 GPUs produce the same B tokens.

So per GPU: bytes / 4, FLOPs unchanged. Arithmetic intensity rises by ~4×. Each GPU individually becomes less memory-bound.

This is important for understanding why TP is nearly free for large models on suitable hardware. It doesn't speed up any single forward pass (you still need to do the FLOPs), but it moves each GPU closer to the compute ceiling, which is exactly what we want.

---

## Parallelism in Practice

### 16.8: The cost of parallelism

All parallelism has overhead. A TP=8 deployment of Llama-3-70B communicates ~5 ms per decode step in AllReduces. On its own, that is ITL overhead. In practice, it is a small fraction of total decode time (~30-40 ms for a typical setup), so it is worth it, but you pay it.

Pipeline parallelism has the bubble cost. Expert parallelism has all-to-all communications that are harder to hide. Context parallelism has ring-pattern latency that grows with sequence length.

For most modern deployments, TP intra-node is "free enough" that you always use it when you need the capacity. The more exotic dimensions are only enabled when a specific constraint forces them.

### 16.9: Where we go next

Chapter 17 introduces a different infrastructure technique: **disaggregated prefill/decode**. Instead of splitting a single workload across GPUs, disaggregation separates *different kinds* of workloads, compute-bound prefill on one GPU pool, memory-bound decode on another. Combined with the parallelism we just covered, disaggregation is the architecture that production systems use to hit tight P99 SLOs at scale.

# Breadcrumb: The Runtime Layer Is Complete

You have now worked through Chapters 13 through 16. Half of the runtime layer plus the first of the infrastructure layer. It is a natural place to pause, because the entire single-GPU optimization story is now in your hands, and we are about to pivot to the multi-GPU world.

---

## What you covered in this block

**Chapter 13** gave you quantization. The third major byte-reduction lever, alongside head compression (Chapter 8) and token compression (Chapter 9). You saw the bit-level structure of floats, the format zoo (FP32, FP16, BF16, FP8, INT8, INT4, ternary), the two paradigms (weight-only vs W8A8), the production algorithms (GPTQ, AWQ, GGUF K-quants, QAT, BitNet 1.58b), and the wide-minimum insight that explains why QAT-trained models quantize better than PTQ ones.

**Chapter 14** made explicit what you had been assuming: **continuous batching**. Iteration-level scheduling, where sequences join and leave the batch dynamically. The two key tuning parameters (`max_num_seqs` and `max_num_batched_tokens`). The mixed-mode batches that let prefill chunks and decodes share a single forward pass. And the dependency between continuous batching and PagedAttention, you cannot have one without the other.

**Chapter 15** introduced speculative decoding. The accept/reject rule that preserves the target distribution exactly. Three methods for producing draft tokens: n-gram matching (free, works best on structured outputs), EAGLE (a trained head on the target's hidden states, 60-80% acceptance), and Medusa (parallel heads, simpler). The 2-3× wall-clock speedup on most workloads, at zero quality cost.

**Chapter 16** moved to the infrastructure layer, the first multi-GPU chapter. Tensor parallelism (intra-node, AllReduces every block), pipeline parallelism (cross-node, small activations), expert parallelism (MoE routing), sequence parallelism, context parallelism. The decision matrix for which parallelism dimension matches which workload. The roofline interpretation: TP lets each GPU be closer to the ridge, though total throughput is unchanged.

---

## The runtime layer, in one sentence per chapter

* **Chapter 5** eliminated redundant compute with the KV cache.
* **Chapter 7** showed the dark side, memory pressure.
* **Chapter 8** compressed across heads, GQA and MLA.
* **Chapter 9** compressed across tokens, sliding window, SSM, Mamba.
* **Chapter 10** tiled attention into SRAM, FlashAttention.
* **Chapter 11** paginated the cache, PagedAttention.
* **Chapter 12** shared prefixes and chunked prefills.
* **Chapter 13** shrank bytes per number, quantization.
* **Chapter 14** scheduled sequences dynamically, continuous batching.
* **Chapter 15** produced multiple tokens per forward pass, speculation.

These ten chapters collectively take a naive PyTorch inference script at ~10 tokens/sec per GPU to a production vLLM deployment at ~2,000-5,000 tokens/sec per GPU on the same hardware. A 200-500× improvement, almost entirely through engineering.

---

## What comes next

Three chapters on the infrastructure layer, four on tooling, one on fine-tuning, three on capstones.

**Chapter 17** is **disaggregated prefill/decode**, separating the compute-bound prefill workload onto GPUs optimized for compute and the memory-bound decode workload onto GPUs optimized for bandwidth. This is the architecture that NVIDIA's NIM, DeepSeek's serving stack, and vLLM v1's disaggregation mode all use.

**Chapter 18** is **replication, routing, and multi-region**. The outermost infrastructure concerns, how to autoscale, how to route requests to the right replica, how to place inference geographically close to users, how cost models work.

**Chapters 19-22** turn to the tooling layer. The anatomy of a vLLM step (what actually happens in the engine), the 2026 landscape of serving engines, the gamified Inference Quest reference, and fine-tuning's relationship to inference economics.

**Chapter 23** tours the frontiers, multimodal (voice, audio, video) and embodied (world models, robotic pipelines). **Chapters 24-26** are the three capstones: a speed-optimized inference server, scaling to 1 million users on Modal, and OpenClaw-RL, a self-improving WhatsApp assistant.

---

## Where we go now

Chapter 17, disaggregated prefill/decode. The final big idea of the infrastructure layer.

# Chapter 17: Disaggregated Prefill / Decode

Chapter 3 drew a line between prefill and decode that has persisted through the entire book: prefill is compute-bound, decode is memory-bound. Chapter 14 said that modern serving engines run both workloads on the same GPU, interleaving them via chunked prefill and continuous batching. That works. But there is a tension. **Compute-bound workloads want a different GPU than memory-bound workloads do.** A GPU optimized for compute (lots of tensor cores, modest HBM bandwidth) is wasted on memory-bound decode. A GPU optimized for memory bandwidth (wide HBM, less peak compute) is wasted on compute-bound prefill. Running both on one GPU means always being mis-matched for one of them.

**Disaggregated prefill/decode** is the architectural answer. Put prefill on one pool of GPUs, tuned for compute. Put decode on another pool, tuned for memory bandwidth. When a user's prefill completes, transfer their KV cache to a decode GPU and let them stream from there. The result is dramatically better P99 latency than any aggregated system can deliver, at the cost of a minimum 2-GPU deployment and some KV-transfer latency.

This is the architecture NVIDIA's NIM uses by default. It is what DeepSeek's production stack uses. It is what vLLM v1's disaggregation mode implements. And in 2026 it is the standard for any production deployment that has strict P99 SLOs (voice, interactive chat, enterprise tiers). This chapter walks through exactly why it works, what the KV transfer looks like, and when the added complexity is worth it.

## The P99 Problem Nobody Talks About

### 17.1: What happens when a long prefill lands on a decode GPU

Chapter 12 introduced chunked prefill as a scheduling-level answer to head-of-line blocking. When a user arrives with a 16K-token prompt, instead of running one monolithic forward pass that stalls all ongoing decodes, we break the prefill into chunks of 512 tokens and interleave with decodes.

Chunked prefill helps. It does not fully solve the problem.

![Figure 17.1: The problem: prefill requests cause decode ITL spikes](figures/ch17-fig1-itl-spike-problem/final.png)
*Figure 17.1.* A two-lane timeline. Top: User A decoding tokens at ~50 ms ITL, until t=300 ms, then a big gap of 800 ms with no tokens, then resumes. Bottom: User B arriving at t=300 ms with a 16K-token prefill, a long solid block from t=300 to t=1100 ms. Annotation: "User A's P99 ITL spikes from 50 ms to 850 ms."

Figure 17.1 shows the pathology even with chunked prefill. User B's 16K prefill, even chunked, takes a substantial fraction of GPU cycles for seconds. User A's decodes slow down for the duration of the stall. The ITL of individual tokens stays close to baseline, but the *arrival pattern* becomes bursty, the first chunk of B's prefill forces A to wait 20 ms instead of 50 ms ITL, etc. Aggregated across many users and many prefill arrivals, the P99 ITL degrades measurably.

This is an infrastructure problem, not a runtime one. Inside one GPU, the two workloads will always compete. Chunked prefill minimizes but does not eliminate the friction.

### 17.2: What it looks like on a production dashboard

![Figure 17.2: Decode ITL measured in production over 10 minutes](figures/ch17-fig2-itl-spike-measured/final.png)
*Figure 17.2.* A line chart of ITL over time. X-axis: 0-10 minutes. Y-axis: ITL (ms), 0 to 1000. A mostly-flat line hovering around 50 ms, punctuated by 3 tall spikes reaching 400-900 ms each. Annotations on the spikes: "big prefill arrived," "several prefills within 2 seconds," "viral chat with 24K prefix."

Figure 17.2 is what a production dashboard actually looks like. Most of the time, ITL is fine. Sometimes, a big prefill or a cluster of prefills arrives and ITL spikes. The spikes are what break P99 SLOs.

If your SLO is P99 ITL < 100 ms and you see spikes to 800 ms, you are failing. You can tune `max_num_batched_tokens` and `long_prefill_token_threshold` to make chunks smaller, which smooths the spikes but lengthens TTFT. No single-GPU tuning removes them. The problem is fundamental: one GPU cannot serve two workloads with opposite characteristics without compromise.

## The Disaggregated Architecture

### 17.3: Two pools of GPUs, one pipeline

![Figure 17.3: The solution: separate prefill GPU and decode GPU](figures/ch17-fig3-disaggregated-solution/final.png)
*Figure 17.3.* Two GPU boxes side by side. Left "GPU 0, Prefill only": processes 4 prefills in parallel; label "compute-bound, saturates tensor cores." Right "GPU 1, Decode only": processes 24 decode requests in parallel; label "memory-bound, saturates HBM bandwidth." Between them, a thick arrow: "KV cache transfer: after prefill completes, K and V transferred to decode GPU."

Figure 17.3 is the disaggregated architecture. Two GPU pools. The prefill pool runs forward passes on freshly arriving prompts, computing the full KV cache. The decode pool runs the autoregressive loop, generating output tokens one at a time. A user's lifecycle is: arrive → prefill GPU → transfer KV → decode GPU → stream output.

The key property: **no prefill work happens on the decode GPU**. A 16K prompt hitting the system does not touch the decode pool at all. Users currently decoding on the decode pool see no contention from incoming prefills. ITL stays flat.

The prefill pool can batch aggressively since all its work is compute-bound, running 8 prefills concurrently on a compute-saturated GPU is fine. The decode pool can batch aggressively too, since all its work is memory-bound, running 32 concurrent decodes on a bandwidth-saturated GPU is the peak utilization regime. Both pools run at near-ideal operating points simultaneously.

### 17.4: The KV cache transfer

The plumbing between the two pools is the KV cache transfer.

![Figure 17.4: KV cache transfer from prefill GPU to decode GPU](figures/ch17-fig4-kv-transfer-mechanics/final.png)
*Figure 17.4.* Left: prefill GPU with the full KV cache for a 4K-token prompt (80 layers, 32 KV heads, 128 dim = 5 GB). Arrow: "NVLink at 900 GB/s, transfer takes ~6 ms." Right: decode GPU receiving the KV cache into its HBM. Annotation: "One-time per request, amortized over hundreds of decode steps. Negligible cost."

Figure 17.4 shows the transfer. For a 4K-token prefill on Llama-3-70B, the KV cache is roughly 5 GB. Over NVLink at 900 GB/s, this transfer takes ~6 ms. If the user then decodes 500 tokens at ~30 ms each, the total decode time is 15 seconds. The 6 ms transfer is 0.04% overhead. Negligible.

For inter-node transfers (over InfiniBand at 50 GB/s), the 5 GB transfer takes 100 ms. Still small relative to total decode time but starting to matter for very short outputs. Production disaggregated systems keep prefill and decode pools in the same node when possible, and use MLA-compressed KV caches (Chapter 8) to keep transfer sizes small.

Several open-source implementations exist: NVIDIA's NIXL (NVIDIA Interconnect Exchange Library), vLLM's built-in KV connector, and custom implementations at large cloud providers. The standard is coalescing around NIXL for cross-platform compatibility.

### 17.5: The P:D ratio

Given prefill and decode on separate pools, you need to decide how many GPUs to devote to each.

![Figure 17.5: P:D ratio depends on workload](figures/ch17-fig5-pd-ratio/final.png)
*Figure 17.5.* Two bar charts side by side. Left "Chat (short prompts, long responses)": 1 prefill GPU : 4 decode GPUs (1:4 ratio). Right "RAG with long context (big prompts, short responses)": 4 prefill GPUs : 1 decode GPU (4:1 ratio). Annotation: "Optimal ratio depends on how much your workload spends in prefill vs decode."

Figure 17.5 shows the workload dependence. A chat application has short prompts (a few hundred tokens) and long responses (thousands of tokens). Most of the compute time per user is decode; relatively little is prefill. So the decode pool is the bottleneck, bigger decode pool.

A RAG application has long prompts (retrieved documents, tens of thousands of tokens) and short responses (a few sentences). Most of the compute time per user is prefill. So the prefill pool is the bottleneck, bigger prefill pool.

There is no universally correct ratio. You measure your workload's prefill-to-decode compute ratio and allocate accordingly. A 1:4 ratio is the common default for chat; 4:1 or higher for document-heavy applications.

### 17.6: Specialized hardware for each pool

![Figure 17.6: Specialized rooflines: prefill GPU vs decode GPU](figures/ch17-fig6-specialized-rooflines/final.png)
*Figure 17.6.* Two stacked roofline plots. Top: "Prefill GPU operating point", prefill dot near the compute ceiling (compute-bound region). Annotation: "Runs FP16/FP8 tensor cores at near-peak." Bottom: "Decode GPU operating point", decode dot below ridge, in the memory-bound region. Annotation: "Runs large batches of concurrent decodes, saturating HBM bandwidth." Middle annotation: "Different hardware optimizes each workload. H100 for prefill, maybe H20 or B200 for decode."

Figure 17.6 is the subtler benefit of disaggregation. Once prefill and decode are on separate GPUs, you can buy *different* GPUs for each pool.

NVIDIA has started to offer this explicitly. The H20 has reduced compute but similar HBM bandwidth to H100, perfect for decode. The H100 has full compute and decent HBM, good for prefill. A production deployment could mix: H100s for prefill, H20s for decode, optimized for each workload's roofline regime.

Beyond the single-GPU picture, a large data-center deployment might use Cerebras or Groq for prefill (extreme compute saturation) and standard GPUs for decode, or vice versa.

### 17.7: Cost and complexity

Disaggregation is not free.

![Figure 17.7: Disaggregated P/D cost-benefit](figures/ch17-fig7-cost-benefit/final.png)
*Figure 17.7.* A 2×3 table. Column 1 "Pros": "Zero ITL spikes from prefill." "Specialized GPU per workload." "Better P99 latency SLOs." Column 2 "Cons": "Needs at least 2 GPUs (minimum cost)." "Adds ~5 ms KV transfer latency." "More complex orchestration." Row 3 "When to use": "Production at >100 concurrent users, P99 matters, budget allows 2+ GPUs." Row 4 "When NOT to use": "Small-scale demos, single-user workloads, budget-constrained."

Figure 17.7 names the costs:

* **Minimum 2 GPUs.** A disaggregated deployment with 1 GPU is nonsensical. You need at least one prefill and one decode.
* **KV transfer overhead.** Small in absolute terms (~5 ms) but non-zero and adds to TTFT.
* **Orchestration complexity.** Two pools need coordinated scheduling, failover handling, health checks, autoscaling policies for each pool independently.

For very small deployments (single-digit concurrent users), a single GPU with chunked prefill is simpler and roughly equivalent. For mid-sized deployments (tens of users) where P99 matters, disaggregation starts to pay off. For large-scale production (hundreds to thousands of users), disaggregation is effectively mandatory.

### 17.8: The KV connector in detail

![Figure 17.8: The KV connector mechanism](figures/ch17-fig8-kv-connector/final.png)
*Figure 17.8.* A central "KV Connector" module drawn as a rectangular pipe between two GPUs. Left (prefill GPU): computes KV cache, "push K and V blocks into the connector buffer." Right (decode GPU): "pull K and V blocks into its own block pool." Below, the connector's internals stacked: "Serialization (pack K and V tensors), Optional compression (FP8 during transit), Transport (NVLink / RDMA / TCP), Deserialization and allocation on receiving GPU."

Figure 17.8 shows the KV connector interface. The main operations:

1. **Publish.** The prefill GPU, on completing a prefill, writes its KV cache into the connector's outgoing buffer. The cache is typically paged (Chapter 11) so this is a set of block-ID/payload pairs.
2. **Transport.** The connector routes the blocks over the fabric, NVLink (intra-node), RDMA over InfiniBand (inter-node), or TCP (fallback). Optional FP8 compression reduces transit size at the cost of numerical precision.
3. **Receive.** The decode GPU allocates blocks in its own paged pool and copies the data into them. Builds a block table for the user.
4. **Activate.** The user's session, previously parked in a "waiting for KV" state, becomes active on the decode pool.

The design is reminiscent of OS-kernel page-migration mechanisms. NIXL adds specific optimizations for inference: block-level parallelism, overlapping transfer with compute, automatic load balancing.

### 17.9: Production latency comparison

![Figure 17.9: Aggregated vs disaggregated latency](figures/ch17-fig9-latency-comparison/final.png)
*Figure 17.9.* A grouped bar chart. Three percentile groups: P50, P90, P99. For each percentile, two bars: aggregated and disaggregated. Numbers: P50 TTFT agg 200 ms, disagg 180 ms (small win). P90 TTFT agg 450 ms, disagg 240 ms (bigger). P99 TTFT agg 2200 ms, disagg 310 ms (huge). Annotation: "Disaggregation's biggest win is in the tail. Medians improve slightly; P99 improves ~7×."

Figure 17.9 shows the production impact at scale. Disaggregation barely affects the median, which was already fine. It dramatically flattens the tail, because prefills no longer contend with decodes. P99 TTFT improvements of 5-10× are realistic, and P99 ITL improvements are similar.

If your business requires P99 SLOs (enterprise tier, regulated industries, voice-critical applications), this is the improvement that justifies the added complexity.

### 17.10: Real production architectures

![Figure 17.10: Real production disaggregated architectures](figures/ch17-fig10-production-architectures/final.png)
*Figure 17.10.* Two side-by-side architectural diagrams. Left "NVIDIA NIM": Router → [Prefill cluster: 4 H100s] → NVLink transfer → [Decode cluster: 16 H100s]. Annotation: "Prefill uses TP=4. Decode uses PagedAttention + continuous batching." Right "DeepSeek-V3": Router → [Prefill: 2 nodes] → NVLink → [Decode: 8 nodes]. Annotation: "Uses MLA to reduce KV transfer by ~8×. FP8 throughout."

Figure 17.10 shows two real 2026 deployments.

**NVIDIA NIM** is NVIDIA's reference inference architecture. It runs disaggregated by default, with prefill and decode as separate scalable pools. The ratio is configurable; the KV connector is NIXL. Many enterprise customers run NIM as-is.

**DeepSeek-V3** disaggregates across 10 nodes (2 prefill, 8 decode) with a MLA-compressed cache that makes the cross-node KV transfer cheap. Because MLA compresses the cache by ~8×, the transfer time for a long-context prefill is seconds-free. FP8 throughout further reduces transfer size.

Other major providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini) have not publicly disclosed their architectures, but production job listings and infrastructure talks suggest similar disaggregated patterns.

## The Infrastructure Layer Comes Together

### 17.11: Parallelism, disaggregation, and the topology question

Chapters 16 and 17 are both infrastructure techniques but attack different problems.

* **Parallelism** (Chapter 16) shards a single workload across multiple GPUs. Inside one pool (prefill or decode), you can use TP, PP, EP, SP, CP as needed.
* **Disaggregation** (this chapter) splits different kinds of workloads onto different pools.

In a real production deployment, both compose. DeepSeek-V3's setup is EP=16 across nodes for the MoE, and disaggregated with 2 prefill nodes and 8 decode nodes. Each node has TP=2. Total: 20 GPUs, 3 orthogonal dimensions of parallelism.

This is the scale at which modern frontier inference operates. Chapter 18 addresses one more dimension, replication, autoscaling, and multi-region, which is the outermost infrastructure layer.

### 17.12: Where we go next

Chapter 18 covers **replication, routing, and multi-region**. Once you have a disaggregated serving pool, you still need to replicate it for horizontal scale, route users to the right replica intelligently, handle traffic spikes via autoscaling, and deploy geographically close to users. This is the last of the infrastructure layer and the bridge into the tooling layer (Chapters 19-21) that puts it all into a shippable engine.

# Chapter 18: Replication, Routing, Multi-Region

Chapters 16 and 17 built the infrastructure for serving a single large model efficiently across a handful of GPUs. This chapter addresses the outermost infrastructure layer, how that setup becomes a production service serving millions of users across the world. Three concerns: **replication** (run multiple copies of your engine for horizontal throughput), **routing** (decide which user hits which replica), and **multi-region deployment** (place inference close to users to beat the speed-of-light penalty).

This is where software engineering meets inference. The techniques below are not unique to LLM serving, they are applied to any high-throughput network service. What is specific is the way each one interacts with the inference stack underneath: cold starts are dominated by model weight loading (minutes, not seconds), routing must be KV-cache-aware to be effective, and geographic placement has to account for both user latency and GPU supply constraints.

This chapter is tactical rather than first-principles. You will not derive an equation in it, but you will come away with the architecture of a production inference fleet that serves real users at real scale.

---

## 18.1: Replication: the simplest horizontal scale

![Figure 18.1: Replication: clone the engine across GPUs](figures/ch18-fig1-replication/final.png)
*Figure 18.1.* Top: a single "Router" box. Below, 4 identical replicas drawn as 4 boxes, each labeled "vLLM engine replica, 1 × H100." Each replica loads the same model weights independently. Arrow from router to each replica labeled "route request (round-robin / least-busy)." Annotation: "Each replica serves requests independently. Total throughput = replicas × per-replica throughput."

Figure 18.1 shows replication in its purest form. Each replica is a complete, independent inference engine, same model, same config, same serving stack. A router sits in front and distributes requests.

Replication gives you linear horizontal throughput. If one replica serves 20 concurrent users at 3,000 tokens/sec total, eight replicas serve 160 concurrent users at 24,000 tokens/sec. The only thing that does not scale linearly is cost, eight replicas cost roughly 8× the rental of one, plus a small overhead for the router and orchestration.

Replication is the right answer when your model fits on one GPU (or one node, with TP) and your concurrency need exceeds one replica's capacity. If your concurrency need exceeds one replica, you scale up the number of replicas rather than try to cram more users onto one. This is the default architecture for small-to-medium models (7B, 13B, 70B) at moderate-to-large traffic.

## 18.2: The cold start problem

The dominant operational pain in replicated serving is **cold starts**.

![Figure 18.2: The cold start problem](figures/ch18-fig2-cold-start/final.png)
*Figure 18.2.* A horizontal timeline. t=0 s: "Traffic spike detected. Trigger autoscaler." t=5 s: "Request new VM from cloud provider." t=30 s: "VM allocated. Image download starts." t=90 s: "Image ready. Load model weights from blob storage (140 GB at 1 GB/s = 140 s)." t=230 s: "Model loaded into GPU HBM." t=240 s: "CUDA graph capture + warmup." t=250 s: "Ready to serve." Red bracket: "Cold start: 4 minutes."

Figure 18.2 traces a cold start. A new replica takes about 4 minutes from "scaled up" to "serving traffic." The specific breakdown:

* **VM allocation**: ~30 seconds. The cloud provider assigns a GPU node to you.
* **Image download**: ~60 seconds. The container image (PyTorch, vLLM, CUDA libs) is pulled from the registry.
* **Model weight load**: **~140 seconds**. This is the dominant cost. Loading 140 GB of Llama-3-70B weights from blob storage to GPU HBM, even at 1 GB/s transfer rates, takes over 2 minutes.
* **CUDA graph capture + warmup**: ~10 seconds. Pre-capture the decode graph so first-request latency is low.

Four minutes is too slow to handle a spike. If you see 2× traffic suddenly, by the time your new replica is serving, the spike may be over, and if it is not, your existing replicas are over-subscribed for 4 minutes of P99 degradation.

The common fix: **warm pools**. Keep a buffer of replicas idling (paying for GPU rental, not serving traffic) that can be activated in seconds. The autoscaling decision becomes "if utilization > 70%, activate a warm replica" rather than "if utilization > 70%, spin up a new one." The cost of the warm pool is real (~20-30% extra GPUs), but it is the price of meeting P99 SLOs during bursts.

## 18.3: Routing strategies

![Figure 18.3: Load balancing strategies](figures/ch18-fig3-load-balancing-strategies/final.png)
*Figure 18.3.* Three panels. Panel 1 "Round-robin": 4 replicas; requests go 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → ... Annotation: "Simple. Ignores replica load." Panel 2 "Least-busy (active connections)": 4 replicas with load counters (5, 12, 3, 8). New request goes to the 3-count replica. Annotation: "Better. Needs real-time load visibility." Panel 3 "Sticky session (KV-cache-aware)": replicas have partial KV cache for specific users; new request from known user routes back to its own replica. Annotation: "Best for multi-turn chat (keeps prefix cache warm)."

Figure 18.3 shows three common routing strategies.

**Round-robin** is the lazy default. It distributes requests evenly across replicas. It ignores per-replica load, so it can send requests to an already-busy replica while another sits idle, which is bad under heterogeneous workloads.

**Least-busy** routing picks the replica with the fewest active requests (or lowest recent load). This requires real-time load telemetry, usually a heartbeat every few hundred milliseconds. More complex but handles heterogeneity.

**Sticky session / KV-cache-aware** routing goes further. If user X was recently served by replica Y, their KV cache (at least for the system prompt and conversation history) is likely still in Y's prefix cache. Sending their next request to Y gives a cache hit and saves TTFT. Sending them anywhere else forces cold prefix recomputation. For multi-turn chat workloads, this routing can cut average TTFT by 2-3× compared to least-busy.

Production engines typically combine these: sticky routing with least-busy fallback when the "home" replica is overloaded.

## 18.4: Autoscaling

![Figure 18.4: Autoscaling triggers](figures/ch18-fig4-autoscaling-triggers/final.png)
*Figure 18.4.* Two stacked line charts sharing an x-axis (time). Top: "Incoming requests per second", a noisy line with a visible traffic spike. Bottom: "Replicas provisioned", a stepped staircase following the spikes with a ~2-minute lag. Replica chart annotated: "Scale up if P99 TTFT > 500 ms for 60 s. Scale down if GPU utilization < 30% for 5 min."

Figure 18.4 is autoscaling. The goal is: replicas track traffic demand, not too loose (over-provisioned, wastes money) and not too tight (under-provisioned, breaks SLOs).

The standard signals:

* **Scale up** when P99 TTFT exceeds SLO for 30-60 seconds continuously. Or when per-replica utilization exceeds 70-80%. React quickly, a slow scale-up means users see degraded service.
* **Scale down** when utilization falls below 30% for several minutes continuously. React slowly, premature scale-down means you have to cold-start back up, which is painful.

The asymmetry is important: scale up fast, scale down slow. Cold starts are expensive; over-provisioning by 10-20% for a while is cheap.

## 18.5: Multi-region deployment

![Figure 18.5: Multi-region deployment](figures/ch18-fig5-multi-region-map/final.png)
*Figure 18.5.* A simplified world map with four data-center markers: US-West, US-East, EU, Asia. User icons scattered globally, each with an arrow to the nearest data center. Each region annotated: "P99 TTFT within region: 200 ms. Cross-region: 400-900 ms." Callout: "Latency-sensitive workloads (voice, interactive) require regional deployments."

Figure 18.5 shows multi-region. Light travels through fiber at about 2/3 c. A packet from Singapore to Virginia takes ~180 ms of pure speed-of-light time, ~200 ms with routing overhead. For interactive applications (voice tutors, voice assistants, live chat), that is a product-killing penalty *before* inference even starts.

The fix: deploy the same serving stack into each major region. Route users to the nearest region. Sync only what has to be synced globally (routing tables, billing counters, model updates).

The cost of multi-region is real. Each region needs its own warm pool, its own replicas, its own monitoring. For a mid-sized product, running in 4 regions roughly quadruples your fixed costs. Most products start with one region and add more as latency becomes the limiter.

## 18.6: Routing by model and SLO

![Figure 18.6: Routing by model and SLO](figures/ch18-fig6-routing-by-slo/final.png)
*Figure 18.6.* Top: a "Smart Router" box. Below, 3 replica pools. Pool 1: "Llama-3 70B on 4× H100, premium users, P99 500 ms." Pool 2: "Llama-3 8B on 1× H100, free-tier users, P99 500 ms." Pool 3: "Llama-3 70B on RTX 5090, batch jobs, no SLO." Incoming requests tagged with user tier, model, SLO; router dispatches to the right pool. Annotation: "Routing is the control plane of the inference fleet."

Figure 18.6 shows routing by tier. Different users (premium vs free), different workloads (interactive vs batch), different models (small fast vs large smart) route to different pools. The router is a software service that reads request metadata and picks the right pool.

Production routing logic can be surprisingly complex. DynaRoute (Chapter 0) routes by query difficulty. LangChain-style systems route by task type. A serving platform might route by customer tier and concurrency allotment.

The router is usually stateless and replicated; the state lives in observability (per-pool load, latency) pulled via hearbeats.

## 18.7: Cost model

![Figure 18.7: Cost breakdown](figures/ch18-fig7-cost-model/final.png)
*Figure 18.7.* A pie chart. Segments: "GPU rental: 55%," "Cold-start overhead: 12%," "Orchestration + routing: 5%," "Network egress: 8%," "Observability: 3%," "Idle capacity (safety headroom): 17%." Annotation: "Idle capacity is the hidden cost, running at 60% average utilization leaves 40% on the table."

Figure 18.7 decomposes where the money goes. GPU rental is dominant, but the "idle capacity" line is the one that surprises most new SREs. You are not running at 100% utilization, you are running at 60-70% to have headroom for traffic spikes. The cost of that headroom is on your bill every hour.

The inference engineer's job is to push average utilization up while maintaining SLO headroom. Continuous batching, PagedAttention, and disaggregation (previous chapters) all contribute. Better autoscaling can too.

## 18.8: Spot capacity

![Figure 18.8: Spot capacity](figures/ch18-fig8-spot-capacity/final.png)
*Figure 18.8.* A timeline showing a request being served by a spot replica. At some unpredictable moment, the cloud provider reclaims the GPU; replica is killed mid-request. Annotation: "Spot GPUs 60-70% cheaper but reclaimed with ~30-second notice." Right side: "Mitigations: checkpoint KV cache every N seconds, fallback to on-demand on preemption, use spot only for batch jobs."

Figure 18.8 shows the spot-capacity trade-off. Cloud providers offer "spot" (preemptible) GPUs at 60-70% discount, but can reclaim them with a few-seconds warning. Using spot for interactive serving is risky, you can lose mid-request replicas unpredictably. Using spot for batch work is fine; batch jobs can checkpoint and resume.

For large production deployments, a common pattern is: on-demand GPUs for the core SLO-meeting capacity (never preempted), spot GPUs for burst capacity during peaks (can be reclaimed when not critical). The savings can be 20-30% on total GPU bill.

## 18.9: Disaster recovery

![Figure 18.9: Disaster recovery: replica failure and failover](figures/ch18-fig9-disaster-recovery/final.png)
*Figure 18.9.* Top: "Router" box. Below, 4 replicas, one CRASHED (red X). Flow: incoming request routes around the dead replica to the 3 surviving ones. A healthcheck (every 2 s) detects the failure in ~5 s. A new replica is provisioned from the autoscaler (cold start ~4 min). Annotation: "During the 4-minute gap, surviving replicas absorb load. If they saturate, P99 spikes."

Figure 18.9 shows the failure mode. Hardware dies. Replicas crash. Software has bugs. A production inference fleet must survive losing a replica.

The standard design: health checks every 2-5 seconds detect a crashed replica in a few seconds. The router stops sending new requests to it. The autoscaler provisions a replacement (4 minutes). During the gap, surviving replicas handle the extra load. As long as you provision for "N+1" (one more replica than peak load requires), a single failure is absorbed without SLO breach.

For stricter SLOs (banking, medical), you run "N+2" or full active-active multi-region redundancy.

## 18.10: The full stack

![Figure 18.10: Full stack architecture](figures/ch18-fig10-full-stack/final.png)
*Figure 18.10.* A layered top-to-bottom architecture. Top: "User / Client." Next: "Edge / CDN." Next: "Global load balancer (DNS-based geo-routing)." Next: "Regional router, chooses model + replica pool." Next: "Replica pool, 8-32 replicas, autoscaled." Each replica: "vLLM engine with PagedAttention + continuous batching." Bottom: "GPU hardware: H100 / B200 / A100." Annotation: "Every layer adds latency (2-40 ms each). Production systems budget them carefully."

Figure 18.10 shows the production inference stack end to end. A user request travels through six layers before hitting the GPU, and back through six layers to return. Each layer adds latency, typically 2-40 ms, and each must be provisioned for peak load.

The infrastructure-layer chapters (16, 17, 18) cover layers 3-5 of this stack. The runtime-layer chapters (7-15) cover layer 6, inside the replica. Together they define what happens between "user clicks" and "tokens stream." Chapter 19 will step inside one replica and tour the vLLM engine in detail.

## 18.11: Where we go next

Chapter 19 opens the vLLM engine and walks through exactly what happens on one decode step, the scheduler, the worker, the block pool, the sampler, the detokenizer. If infrastructure is about the space between engines, tooling is about what is inside one. Chapter 19 starts that treatment.

# Chapter 19: Anatomy of a vLLM Step

Chapters 16-18 covered the space between engines, how engines are replicated, routed to, disaggregated, and autoscaled. Chapter 19 opens up **inside** one engine. Specifically, vLLM, because it is the production default in 2026 and the engine most inference engineers interact with daily.

This chapter traces what happens, in concrete terms, during one decode step of a vLLM-based serving engine. We look at the startup sequence (partitioning HBM, pre-capturing CUDA graphs), the block pool management (how free KV blocks are tracked), the scheduling loop (deciding which users go in the next forward pass), the forward pass itself (the work the GPU actually does), the sampler (turning logits into tokens), and the streaming response (sending tokens back to users).

The level of detail is deliberate. When you tune a production vLLM deployment, the knobs you are adjusting control specific parts of this flow. When you read a vLLM configuration, every field maps to a mechanism here. When you debug a production issue, the failure modes correspond to specific stages. By the end of Chapter 19, you can read vLLM's source code and know what you are looking at.

## 19.1: The architecture, in one picture

![Figure 19.1: vLLM: engine, workers, scheduler](figures/ch19-fig1-vllm-architecture/final.png)
*Figure 19.1.* A large rounded rectangle labeled "LLMEngine." Inside, three components: Scheduler (top-left), Block Pool (middle), Workers (bottom-right). Surrounding: Processor (tokenizer, detokenizer) on the left, Output streamer (pushes tokens to user) on the right. Arrows show flow: user request → Processor → Engine.scheduler.admit → Worker.forward → sampling → Output streamer → user.

Figure 19.1 is the high-level structure. vLLM is organized around an `LLMEngine` object that owns three key collaborators: the **Scheduler** (decides which user sequences run in each forward pass), the **Block Pool** (manages KV cache memory, Chapter 11's PagedAttention), and the **Workers** (one per GPU, runs the actual transformer forward pass).

Around the engine sit two thinner components: the **Processor** (tokenizes input, detokenizes output) and the **Output Streamer** (pushes each new token back to the user via HTTP SSE or WebSocket).

When a request arrives, this is the full flow:

1. Processor tokenizes the prompt.
2. Engine.scheduler receives the tokenized request and holds it in a waiting queue.
3. On each decode step, the scheduler promotes some waiting requests to the running batch (respecting memory and concurrency limits).
4. Workers execute the forward pass on the running batch.
5. Sampler converts logits to tokens.
6. Output streamer pushes new tokens to the user.
7. The scheduler updates its state for the next step.

Each of the remaining sections examines one of these stages.

## 19.2: Startup: partitioning GPU memory

![Figure 19.2: Engine startup: partitioning GPU HBM](figures/ch19-fig2-startup-memory-split/final.png)
*Figure 19.2.* A horizontal bar representing 80 GB of H100 HBM, with three segments: "Model weights (FP16, loaded from disk), 40 GB." "Activation workspace (peak forward pass), 5 GB." "KV cache block pool, 35 GB." Annotation: "At startup, vLLM does a dummy forward pass to measure activation peak, then allocates the rest as blocks." Side callout: "Number of blocks = 35 GB / block\_size\_bytes. At block\_size=16, that is ~140,000 blocks per GPU."

Figure 19.2 shows vLLM's startup sequence. When the engine boots:

1. **Load model weights**. The weights file (usually a safetensors or pickle file) is read from disk and copied into GPU HBM. For Llama-3-70B at FP16, that is 140 GB, taking ~140 seconds at typical storage speeds, the dominant cost of cold start.
2. **Dummy forward pass**. The engine runs one forward pass with artificial inputs to measure peak activation memory. This becomes the activation workspace.
3. **Compute remaining HBM**. `total_hbm - weights - activations = available_for_kv_cache`.
4. **Allocate the block pool**. Divide available HBM into fixed-size blocks (default 16 tokens per block). For 70B on 2× H100 with TP, each GPU holds half the weights and sees ~35 GB available for blocks, about 140,000 blocks.
5. **Pre-capture CUDA graphs**. Record the decode forward pass as a CUDA graph for fast replay. vLLM captures graphs for a range of batch sizes (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32) so most common cases hit a pre-captured graph at runtime.

After startup, the engine is ready to accept requests.

## 19.3: The block pool

![Figure 19.3: Block pool: a FIFO queue of free blocks](figures/ch19-fig3-block-pool-free-queue/final.png)
*Figure 19.3.* A horizontal queue of small blocks labeled "Free block queue (FIFO)." A pointer at the left "head (pop from here)." A pointer at the right "tail (push evicted blocks here)." Annotation: "O(1) allocation and deallocation. Blocks recycle cleanly."

Figure 19.3 shows the core data structure. The block pool is a queue of free block IDs. When a user session needs a block, the engine pops one from the head of the queue. When a session ends (or is evicted), its blocks are pushed back to the tail.

The important property: **allocation is O(1) per block**. vLLM's throughput depends on this. If block allocation took milliseconds, the scheduler would be the bottleneck.

Implementation-wise, vLLM uses a deque plus a reference-count table (for prefix-cached blocks, Chapter 12). The whole thing is lock-free per GPU, workers operate on their own pools without synchronization.

## 19.4: Request lifecycle

![Figure 19.4: Request lifecycle through the vLLM engine](figures/ch19-fig4-request-lifecycle/final.png)
*Figure 19.4.* A horizontal flow of six boxes. 1: "Tokenize prompt." 2: "Enter waiting queue." 3: "Scheduler admits to running queue (allocates KV blocks)." 4: "Prefill forward pass (possibly chunked)." 5: "Decode loop (one token per step, streams out)." 6: "Free KV blocks, close stream."

Figure 19.4 traces a single user request through the engine. Six stages:

* **Tokenize**: runs on CPU, ~1 ms per 1K tokens typically.
* **Wait queue**: the request sits here until the scheduler has room for it (respecting concurrency and memory caps).
* **Admit**: scheduler allocates blocks (one per 16 tokens of the prompt plus a prefix-cache hit check), moves the request from waiting to running queue.
* **Prefill**: run the forward pass on the prompt tokens. If the prompt is long and chunked prefill is enabled, this is spread across multiple forward passes.
* **Decode**: autoregressive generation, one token per forward pass per user.
* **Free**: when the user's output stream ends (EOS token, max length, or client cancellation), their blocks go back to the free pool.

## 19.5: What is a "step"

![Figure 19.5: What exactly is a vLLM "step"?](figures/ch19-fig5-what-is-a-step/final.png)
*Figure 19.5.* A vertical rectangle labeled "One vLLM step = One forward pass + sampling + streaming." Inside, five sub-steps: "(1) Scheduler builds batch (up to max\_num\_batched\_tokens). (2) Worker runs model's forward pass on batch. (3) Sampler selects next token per sequence. (4) Output streamer emits tokens to users. (5) Block manager frees any finished sequences." Annotation: "One step ≈ 30-80 ms on a single H100 for 7B model at batch 32."

Figure 19.5 defines a step. One step is one forward pass plus the scheduling that goes around it. The wall-clock time is dominated by the forward pass, roughly 30 ms per step for Llama-3-8B at batch 32 on H100.

Everything else is cheap. Scheduling takes ~100 μs. Sampling takes ~1 ms. Detokenization takes ~500 μs. The step's duration is essentially the forward pass time.

## 19.6: max\_num\_seqs and max\_num\_batched\_tokens

![Figure 19.6: max_num_seqs and max_num_batched_tokens interact](figures/ch19-fig6-max-num-seqs-budget/final.png)
*Figure 19.6.* A 2D scatter plot visualization. X-axis: concurrent sequences (0-256). Y-axis: tokens in batch (0-8192). Three scenarios as points: A = 32 sequences all decoding (1 token each) = 32 tokens → low on both. B = 8 sequences all prefilling 4096 tokens each = 32,768 → maxes out y-axis, OOM. C = 16 decode + 4 chunked prefill of 512 = 2064 → healthy. A shaded "feasible region" bounded by both axis maxes.

Figure 19.6 shows the two parameters from Chapter 14 in action. Every forward pass's total token count has to fit under `max_num_batched_tokens`; the total sequence count has to fit under `max_num_seqs`. These are two independent caps; breaking either one is an error.

Tuning them is the largest runtime decision for a vLLM operator. Too-low values leave throughput on the table. Too-high values OOM on KV cache or cause per-step time to blow up. The right values depend on the model size, the GPU, and the workload distribution.

## 19.7: Chunked prefill token budget

![Figure 19.7: How chunked prefill shares the token budget](figures/ch19-fig7-chunked-prefill-budget/final.png)
*Figure 19.7.* Horizontal token budget bar labeled "max\_num\_batched\_tokens = 4096." Filled segments: "16 ongoing decodes (1 token each) = 16." "3 chunked-prefill sequences with chunk size 1024 = 3072." "Remaining 1008 tokens: a fourth prefill chunk." Annotation: "Scheduler greedily packs. Decode tokens admitted first (cannot be chunked)."

Figure 19.7 shows how the scheduler uses the budget. Decodes are always admitted first (they produce one token each; cannot be postponed). After decodes are placed, any remaining budget is filled with prefill chunks up to the cap. If your prefill chunks are 1024 tokens, and you have 16 decodes using 16 tokens of budget, you can admit 3 full prefill chunks plus a partial fourth.

The default in vLLM v1 is `max_num_batched_tokens = 8192` with chunked prefill enabled, which allows batch compositions like 32 decodes + 8 × 512-token prefill chunks simultaneously.

## 19.8: Token streaming

![Figure 19.8: Token streaming: from GPU to user](figures/ch19-fig8-token-streaming/final.png)
*Figure 19.8.* A flow from left (GPU) to right (user). GPU: "Sampler produces token IDs" → "Detokenizer decodes to text" → "Streaming HTTP server buffers" → "Network" → "Client." Timing annotations: "30 ms GPU + 1 ms detokenizer + 2 ms network = ~33 ms end-to-end per token." Side card: "Detokenization must handle partial UTF-8 tokens carefully."

Figure 19.8 shows the final leg. After sampling, the token ID is passed through the detokenizer (to produce text), then into the streaming HTTP response. At ~30 ms per forward pass and ~3 ms of overhead, end-to-end per-token latency from the user's perspective is ~33 ms. That matches the per-user ITL dashboards of production vLLM deployments.

One subtlety: detokenization has to handle multi-byte UTF-8 characters carefully. If a token ends in the middle of a multi-byte character (e.g., the token for half of an emoji), streaming naively gives the user malformed text. vLLM buffers incomplete UTF-8 sequences and flushes only at character boundaries.

## 19.9: The scheduling loop

![Figure 19.9: The scheduling loop](figures/ch19-fig9-scheduling-loop/final.png)
*Figure 19.9.* A pseudocode flow. 7 steps: (1) "while active sequences:" (2) "evict completed sequences, return blocks." (3) "admit from waiting queue up to budget." (4) "build forward pass batch." (5) "worker.forward(batch)." (6) "sample new tokens." (7) "stream tokens back." Annotation: "Steps 1-4 and 6-7 take microseconds. Step 5 takes milliseconds."

Figure 19.9 is the engine's main loop. On each iteration:

1. **Evict finished sequences.** Users whose last token was EOS or max-length are removed; their blocks go to free pool.
2. **Admit new sequences.** From the waiting queue, pull users that fit in the remaining budget.
3. **Build the batch.** Gather the current states of all running sequences (their KV-cache block IDs, their new input token, etc.).
4. **Worker forward pass.** The actual GPU work.
5. **Sample.** Convert logits to token IDs.
6. **Update state.** Append new tokens to sequences, update block tables.
7. **Stream.** Push new tokens to their users' output streams.

The loop runs continuously. At steady state, one iteration per forward pass, forward pass is ~30 ms, so the engine does ~33 iterations per second per replica. Each iteration advances all active users by one token.

## 19.10: All the parameters, in one diagram

![Figure 19.10: All the vLLM knobs in one picture](figures/ch19-fig10-parameters-together/final.png)
*Figure 19.10.* A central "vLLM Engine" box. Eight parameter labels with arrows pointing in: "max\_num\_seqs," "max\_num\_batched\_tokens," "max\_model\_len," "block\_size," "gpu\_memory\_utilization," "enable\_chunked\_prefill," "enable\_prefix\_caching," "tensor\_parallel\_size." Three output metrics: "Throughput (tokens/sec)," "TTFT (ms)," "ITL (ms)." Annotation: "These 8 knobs are the leverage points for tuning production deployments."

Figure 19.10 collects the production knobs:

* **`max_num_seqs`**: concurrency cap.
* **`max_num_batched_tokens`**: per-step token budget.
* **`max_model_len`**: longest allowed sequence.
* **`block_size`**: KV block granularity (16 or 32 tokens).
* **`gpu_memory_utilization`**: fraction of HBM to reserve (0.9 typical).
* **`enable_chunked_prefill`**: on/off.
* **`enable_prefix_caching`**: on/off.
* **`tensor_parallel_size`**: TP degree.

These eight parameters, set correctly for your workload and hardware, are the difference between a poorly-configured and a well-configured deployment. They do not change the code, they change how the engine schedules work. A 2× throughput improvement from parameter tuning alone is common on a fresh deployment.

## 19.11: Where we go next

Chapter 20 zooms out to the **engine landscape of 2026**. vLLM is the default, but there are alternatives: SGLang, TensorRT-LLM, TGI, Ray Serve. Each has a specific strength and a specific niche. Chapter 20 gives you the decision matrix for picking the right one.

# Chapter 20: The Engine Landscape (2026)

Chapter 19 walked through vLLM in depth. vLLM is the dominant open-source serving engine in 2026, but it is not the only one. This chapter is a tour of the alternatives, what they do, when to pick them, and how the landscape has evolved over four years.

The tone is practical. Each engine has its strengths and its niche. An inference engineer should know which to reach for when the default (vLLM) is not the right answer. Chapter 20 is that reference.

## 20.1: The family tree

![Figure 20.1: The LLM inference engine family tree (2022-2026)](figures/ch20-fig1-engine-family-tree/final.png)
*Figure 20.1.* A horizontal timeline 2022-2026. Tree of boxes connecting inspiration/fork lineage. 2022: "HuggingFace Transformers (pre-engine era)." 2023: "TGI (HF)," "FasterTransformer (NVIDIA)." 2023 late: "vLLM (first PagedAttention)", the big central node. 2024: "TensorRT-LLM (NVIDIA)," "SGLang (RadixAttention)," "LMDeploy." 2025: "vLLM v1 rewrite," "llama.cpp (local)," "Ollama (wrapper over llama.cpp)." 2026: "Modal (serverless)," "Ray Serve + vLLM." Annotation: "vLLM is the center of gravity."

Figure 20.1 traces the lineage. Before 2023, serving an LLM meant running the Hugging Face Transformers library as-is, with static batching and no optimizations. vLLM's introduction in late 2023, with PagedAttention and continuous batching, changed everything. Every subsequent engine either adopts these primitives (sometimes borrowing code directly) or competes on a specific axis.

## 20.2: vLLM

![Figure 20.2: vLLM feature matrix](figures/ch20-fig2-vllm-feature-matrix/final.png)
*Figure 20.2.* A single-column bullet list of features with checkmarks: PagedAttention; Continuous batching; Chunked prefill; Prefix caching; Speculative decoding (N-gram, EAGLE, Medusa); Tensor parallelism; Pipeline parallelism; Disaggregated P/D (experimental); Quantization (AWQ, GPTQ, FP8); Guided decoding (FSM, regex, JSON schema); Multi-LoRA serving; Streaming output.

Figure 20.2 shows what vLLM ships in 2026. Every major runtime technique we have discussed in this book is implemented. The engine is "kitchen-sink", most new serving features land here first.

Default choice for: general-purpose LLM inference, mid-sized to large models, open-weights deployments. If you are not sure what engine to use, use vLLM.

Weaknesses: less integrated with specific hardware optimizations than TensorRT-LLM. Some edge cases (long-context with very specific KV cache layouts) have rough edges. Python-heavy implementation means startup is slower than C++ engines.

## 20.3: SGLang

![Figure 20.3: SGLang: RadixAttention + structured generation](figures/ch20-fig3-sglang/final.png)
*Figure 20.3.* A radix tree diagram. Multiple prompts share common prefix branches (system prompt). Each prompt is a path from root to leaf. Annotation: "RadixAttention indexes prefix cache as a tree; finds maximal shared prefix across unrelated queries." Right side: example showing regex-constrained output, "Generate JSON schema → output guaranteed parseable JSON."

Figure 20.3 shows SGLang's distinctive features. Two things set it apart.

**RadixAttention** takes the prefix caching idea of Chapter 12 further. Instead of a flat hash table of prefixes, it maintains a radix tree of all seen prefixes. This finds maximal shared prefixes across *unrelated* queries, not just within a single conversation. For workloads where many users issue similar prompts (e.g., agentic systems where many agents share a common template), RadixAttention can yield dramatic TTFT reductions even for users who have never interacted with the system before.

**Structured generation** is SGLang's other main strength. If your output must be valid JSON, or match a regex, or follow a specific grammar, SGLang enforces this at the token-sampling level. Every generated token is constrained to keep the output valid. For agentic systems, tool-using LLMs, and structured-output tasks, this is dramatically more reliable than post-hoc parsing and retry.

Pick SGLang when: structured generation matters; your workload has heavy prefix sharing beyond single conversations; tree-of-thought or agentic systems.

## 20.4: TensorRT-LLM

![Figure 20.4: TensorRT-LLM: NVIDIA's compiled kernels](figures/ch20-fig4-tensorrt-llm/final.png)
*Figure 20.4.* A flow: "Your model (PyTorch)" → "TensorRT-LLM compiler (graph optimization + kernel fusion)" → "Custom compiled kernels for H100/B200" → "Faster inference (~2× over vLLM in best cases)." Side annotations: "Pros: best single-GPU perf, NVIDIA's own, tight FP8 integration. Cons: NVIDIA-only, compile step slow, less flexible for research models."

Figure 20.4 shows TensorRT-LLM. It is NVIDIA's own serving engine, and it ships with compiled kernels that exploit every Hopper (H100) and Blackwell (B200) feature aggressively. On NVIDIA hardware specifically, TRT-LLM is the highest-performance option, often 1.5-2× faster per token than vLLM on the same model and hardware.

The cost: you have to compile your model. TRT-LLM takes a PyTorch model, runs a graph-compilation pass, and produces an optimized binary. Compilation is slow (minutes for a 70B model) and not all PyTorch features are supported. For research models that change frequently, this is painful. For production models that are stable for months, it is fine.

Pick TRT-LLM when: you are on NVIDIA hardware, your model is frozen, every percentage point of throughput matters, you can afford the compile step.

## 20.5: Hugging Face TGI

![Figure 20.5: Hugging Face TGI](figures/ch20-fig5-hf-tgi/final.png)
*Figure 20.5.* Central TGI architecture box with features: "Multi-model serving (hot-swap)," "Token authentication & rate limiting," "Built-in Prometheus metrics," "Less feature-rich than vLLM but easier to deploy." Side: "TGI's niche: enterprises that need vendor-supported, stable API surface."

Figure 20.5 shows TGI. It started as Hugging Face's reference serving implementation. Compared to vLLM, it is less aggressive on performance features but more enterprise-ready, stable API, built-in authentication, Prometheus metrics, good documentation, commercial support from Hugging Face.

Pick TGI when: you are an enterprise buying support; you want a stable API surface; you do not need bleeding-edge performance; you want hot model swapping without engine restart.

## 20.6: Ray Serve

![Figure 20.6: Ray Serve: distributed orchestration over vLLM](figures/ch20-fig6-ray-serve/final.png)
*Figure 20.6.* A layered stack. Top: "Application code (Python, FastAPI)." Next: "Ray Serve (autoscaling, routing, load balancing, composition)." Next: "Multiple vLLM replicas per cluster." Bottom: "GPU fleet across multiple nodes." Annotation: "Ray Serve handles cross-replica orchestration. vLLM handles intra-replica inference. Ray Serve + vLLM = reference architecture for large scale."

Figure 20.6 shows Ray Serve. It is not a serving engine replacement, it is an orchestration layer that sits on top of one. The common pattern is: vLLM for inference within a replica, Ray Serve for cross-replica routing, autoscaling, and multi-model deployment.

Ray Serve does the work of Chapter 18 (replication, routing, autoscaling) in a clean distributed-computing framework. For production deployments with dozens or hundreds of replicas, Ray Serve is effectively the standard. Anyscale (Ray's commercial sponsor) offers a managed version.

Pick Ray Serve when: you are running multiple replicas and need orchestration; you want Python-native abstractions for multi-model setups; you plan to scale beyond single-node.

## 20.7: Modal and serverless

![Figure 20.7: Modal: serverless inference](figures/ch20-fig7-modal-serverless/final.png)
*Figure 20.7.* Client request → Modal's control plane → "Container cold starts in ~2 seconds (pre-baked images)" → vLLM runs in container → response. When idle, container scales to zero (no cost). Annotation: "Modal trades constant-cost replicas for per-request pricing."

Figure 20.7 shows Modal. It is a serverless GPU platform, you define inference code in Python, Modal handles the VM spin-up, GPU provisioning, and scaling. Cold starts are ~2 seconds (not 4 minutes, because Modal pre-bakes container images and has a warm pool of VMs ready).

The economics differ. You pay per-second of compute used, not per-hour of allocated GPUs. For bursty workloads (a research prototype, an internal tool) this is cheaper than renting GPUs 24/7. For always-on high-traffic workloads, it is more expensive than dedicated capacity.

Pick Modal when: your workload is bursty, experimental, or under 40% utilization; you want to avoid ops work; you value fast iteration over every last percent of performance.

## 20.8: Local engines: llama.cpp and Ollama

![Figure 20.8: Local-first engines](figures/ch20-fig8-local-engines/final.png)
*Figure 20.8.* Two stacked panels. Top "llama.cpp": C++, supports CPU + Metal (Apple) + CUDA + Vulkan; GGUF quantization format (K-quants, IQ-quants); runs 70B models on a MacBook Pro. Bottom "Ollama": user-friendly wrapper over llama.cpp; one-line model download + run; model library with pre-packaged GGUFs. Annotation: "Brought LLMs to every laptop. Excellent on Apple Silicon."

Figure 20.8 shows the local stack. `llama.cpp` is a C++ implementation that runs LLMs on essentially any hardware: CPUs, Apple M-series chips, NVIDIA GPUs, AMD GPUs, Intel GPUs. Its GGUF quantization format (Chapter 13) is the de facto standard for local inference.

Ollama wraps `llama.cpp` in a developer-friendly UI. `ollama pull llama3.1:8b` downloads a quantized model and makes it callable via a simple API. For individual developers and on-device applications, Ollama is the default.

Pick local engines when: privacy matters (data stays on-device); you are on Apple Silicon; your volume is low; you want zero ops.

## 20.9: Specialty hardware: Cerebras, Groq, Taalas

![Figure 20.9: Specialty hardware inference](figures/ch20-fig9-specialty-hardware/final.png)
*Figure 20.9.* Three side-by-side panels. Cerebras: wafer-scale chip (WSE-3, 900,000 cores); entire model on one chip; ~1000-3000 tok/s per user. Groq: Tensor Streaming Processor (TSP), deterministic pipelines; no caches, no speculation; minimal latency variance; ~500-1500 tok/s. Taalas: model burned into silicon mask itself (ASIC per model); ~17,000 tok/s; most expensive per deployment, but unmatched latency.

Figure 20.9 shows specialty silicon. These are not engines you install, they are hosted inference providers with their own hardware.

**Cerebras** uses a wafer-scale chip that fits an entire frontier model on one piece of silicon, eliminating HBM entirely. Tokens per second per user: 1000-3000. Best-in-class for interactive workloads that need very high per-user throughput.

**Groq** uses deterministic pipeline processors, no caches, no speculation. Every request takes exactly the same time, which is great for predictability but means no per-request optimization. 500-1500 tok/s.

**Taalas** literally burns the trained model into the silicon mask. One ASIC per model. 17,000 tok/s (the fastest deployed). The highest-cost setup, but unmatched for latency-critical workloads.

Use these when: interactive latency is critical; your model is stable enough to justify the switch; the cost per token (which is higher than a well-tuned H100 fleet) is worth it.

## 20.10: Decision matrix

![Figure 20.10: Which engine for which workload](figures/ch20-fig10-decision-matrix/final.png)
*Figure 20.10.* A 7×4 table. Columns: "Default choice," "Tight budget," "Enterprise," "Local / privacy." Rows: (1) Chat/general LLM: vLLM | Ollama | TGI | llama.cpp. (2) Long context (1M tokens): vLLM+CP | Ollama | TGI | llama.cpp. (3) Structured generation/JSON: SGLang | Ollama | TGI+guided | llama.cpp. (4) Very low latency: Groq | llama.cpp | TRT-LLM | llama.cpp. (5) Bursty/spiky: Modal | Ollama | Replicate | Ollama. (6) Batch/offline: vLLM | Ollama | TRT-LLM | llama.cpp. (7) Edge/mobile: llama.cpp or quantized ONNX | n/a | n/a | Ollama.

Figure 20.10 is the decision matrix. Read it horizontally for your workload, then vertically for your constraints. Most production deployments in 2026 land in the "default choice" column, vLLM for general chat, SGLang for structured output, Ray Serve + vLLM for scale, Modal for bursty workloads.

## 20.11: Where we go next

Chapter 21 is a short chapter on the **Inference Quest**, the interactive gamified companion to this book that walks through the vLLM engine as 12 interconnected worlds. It is an optional but delightful way to internalize the material of Chapters 11-19. Chapter 22 then shifts to fine-tuning and its relationship with inference economics.

# Chapter 21: Inference Quest

This chapter is different from the others. It is not a new technique, not a new framework. It is a pointer to a companion artifact: **Inference Quest**, the gamified interactive walkthrough of the vLLM engine that ships alongside this book.

Inference Quest is a single-file HTML experience, no dependencies, no install, that you open in a browser and play through. It contains 12 interconnected "worlds," each teaching one core mechanism of the vLLM serving engine. As you play, a real-time block table, real computations with real numbers, and interactive sliders visualize exactly what the engine does on each forward pass.

Think of it as Chapter 19's material in interactive form. Every concept in that chapter has a corresponding world in the Quest. You can set the parameters (block size, max\_num\_seqs, etc.) at the start screen and watch how your choices affect the subsequent worlds. A student can work through it in 45-60 minutes with running commentary from an instructor; a self-learner can take longer.

This chapter's job is to describe what is in each world, so you can decide whether to play it, when to play it, and what to look for. It is shorter than the rest of the book because the Quest itself is the experience, these pages are a pointer.

## 21.1: The overworld

![Figure 21.1: Inference Quest: the 12-world interactive companion](figures/ch21-fig1-twelve-worlds-overview/final.png)
*Figure 21.1.* A grid overview of 12 world-tiles in a 4×3 layout. Row 1: World 1 Engine Initialization; World 2 Request & Tokenize; World 3 Scheduling & Blocks; World 4 Prefill. Row 2: World 5 Decode; World 6 Sampling; World 7 Continuous Batching; World 8 Chunked Prefill. Row 3: World 9 Speculative Decoding; World 10 Tensor Parallelism; World 11 Disaggregated P/D; World 12 Benchmarking. Sequential arrows connecting tile 1 → tile 2 → ... → tile 12.

Figure 21.1 is the overworld. You start at World 1 and progress through 12 in sequence. Each world is 2-5 minutes of interactive content with a running narrative.

## 21.2: World 1: Engine Initialization

![Figure 21.2: World 1: VRAM partitioning](figures/ch21-fig2-world-1-engine-init/final.png)
*Figure 21.2.* A horizontal VRAM bar labeled "H100 80 GB" divided into three animated segments: "Model weights (40 GB), loaded via torch.cuda.set\_device and state\_dict." "Activation headroom (5 GB), reserved after dummy forward pass." "KV cache block pool (35 GB, carved into ~140K blocks)." Above: "CUDA graph capture" callout explaining that decode graphs are captured for fast replay.

World 1 walks you through exactly what happens between "the engine starts" and "the engine is ready to serve." The VRAM bar animates as each segment is allocated. At the end you can click "proceed" to begin the actual serving.

## 21.3: World 3: Scheduling & Block Allocation

![Figure 21.3: World 3: block allocation](figures/ch21-fig3-world-3-block-allocation/final.png)
*Figure 21.3.* Left: a "free block queue (FIFO)" with 16 pale lavender small blocks. Center: two incoming requests, Req A (5 tokens) needs 2 blocks; Req B (4 tokens) needs 1 block. Right: block table mappings: "Req A → blocks [0, 1]"; "Req B → blocks [2]." Annotation: "Blocks popped from left of queue as requests enter running queue."

World 3 shows the block pool in action. You can drag requests onto the queue and watch blocks get allocated. The block table updates live. When a request finishes, blocks return to the free pool.

## 21.4: World 4: Parallel Prefill

![Figure 21.4: World 4: prefill in one forward pass](figures/ch21-fig4-world-4-prefill-parallel/final.png)
*Figure 21.4.* Two requests side by side: Req A has 5 tokens; Req B has 4 tokens. Flattened into a single super-sequence of 9 tokens. Below: small metadata annotations, "query\_start\_loc: [0, 5, 9]"; "seq\_lens: [5, 4]"; "Causal mask: Req B cannot attend to Req A." Arrow labeled "one transformer forward pass" → 9 output logit vectors. Annotation: "Prefill is compute-bound."

World 4 demonstrates how multiple requests' prefill tokens get packed into a single forward pass. You can see the causal mask preventing cross-request attention. At the end, 9 tokens' logits emerge.

## 21.5: World 5: Memory-Bound Decode

![Figure 21.5: World 5: decode is memory-bound](figures/ch21-fig5-world-5-decode-memory-bound/final.png)
*Figure 21.5.* Two horizontal lanes, one per active request. Each decode step: one new token per request (2 tokens per forward pass total). Annotation: "Decode loads full 7B model (14 GB) for each step, produces only 2 tokens. Memory-bound." Side card: "Effective compute utilization: ~5-10%."

World 5 makes concrete why decode utilization is so poor. You see the 14 GB of weights being loaded to produce 2 tokens of output. The compute side is mostly idle.

## 21.6: World 6: Sampling

![Figure 21.6: World 6: sampling](figures/ch21-fig6-world-6-sampling/final.png)
*Figure 21.6.* Left: raw logits bar chart for 8 vocab tokens. Arrow "temperature scaling: logits / T" → bars reshape. Arrow "softmax" → probability bars summing to 1. Arrows "top-k: keep only k highest" then "top-p: keep until cumulative prob reaches p" → "sample one token." Live sliders: temperature=0.7, top\_k=50, top\_p=0.95.

World 6 has interactive sliders. Move temperature and watch the distribution reshape in real time. See how top-k and top-p prune candidates before sampling. This is the clearest way to build intuition about what those parameters do.

## 21.7: World 7: Continuous Batching

![Figure 21.7: World 7: continuous batching](figures/ch21-fig7-world-7-continuous-batching/final.png)
*Figure 21.7.* Three-row timeline. Req A runs t=0 to t=10. Req B runs t=0 to t=3. At t=3, Req C arrives and takes B's freed blocks; Req C runs t=3 to t=10. Block table side diagram: at t=3, blocks that were B's are now C's (color changes). Annotation: "Blocks freed by B instantly reused for C. No idle time."

World 7 shows continuous batching as a time-lapse. You can pause, rewind, and watch sequences enter and leave the batch in real time.

## 21.8: World 8: Chunked Prefill

![Figure 21.8: World 8: chunked prefill](figures/ch21-fig8-world-8-chunked-prefill/final.png)
*Figure 21.8.* Top lane: Req A decoding, tokens popping every 50 ms, uninterrupted. Bottom lane: Req B (new) 24-token prefill divided into 3 chunks of 8. Each chunk processed in one forward pass, interleaved with Req A's decode. Token-budget bar at top: "max\_num\_batched\_tokens = 16."

World 8 demonstrates how chunked prefill keeps decodes smooth. Visual confirmation that the interleaving works.

## 21.9: World 9: Speculative Decoding

![Figure 21.9: World 9: speculative decoding](figures/ch21-fig9-world-9-speculative/final.png)
*Figure 21.9.* Three rounds. Round 1: draft proposes 4 candidate "ghost" tokens; target verifies; 3 accepted, 1 rejected (shattered animation). Round 2: 4 proposed, 2 accepted. Round 3: 4 proposed, 4 accepted. Running speedup meter: "Avg 3× speedup." Annotation: "Output mathematically identical to vanilla. Only speed changes."

World 9 has the most visually compelling animations. Draft tokens appear as pale ghosts; the target model verifies; accepted tokens solidify, rejected ones shatter. The speedup meter tracks the cumulative acceptance rate.

## 21.10: World 12: Benchmarking

![Figure 21.10: World 12: the benchmarking dashboard](figures/ch21-fig10-world-12-benchmarking/final.png)
*Figure 21.10.* A mockup dashboard with 4 widgets. Widget 1: TTFT live chart with SLO line at 200 ms. Widget 2: ITL live chart with SLO line at 50 ms. Widget 3: Throughput live number. Widget 4: SLO compliance (two green/red status bars, P99 TTFT PASS, P99 TPOT PASS). Below: sliders for "Prompt length (16-4096)," "Batch size (1-64)," "TP degree (1-8)", all interactive.

World 12 is the capstone. It synthesizes everything into a benchmarking dashboard. You can move sliders, prompt length, batch size, TP degree, and see the TTFT, ITL, and throughput numbers update in real time. The SLO compliance bars go green or red depending on your parameter choices. Playing with this is the fastest way to build intuition about the trade-offs discussed in Chapter 2 and Chapter 14.

## 21.11: How to use it in practice

Inference Quest is optional. You can finish this book without playing it. But if you learn by doing, or if you are teaching a workshop, Inference Quest is the best way to internalize Chapters 11-19. A typical flow:

1. Read Chapters 7-14.
2. Play worlds 1-9 of Inference Quest (90 minutes).
3. Return to the book for Chapters 15-19.
4. Play worlds 9-12 (with the benchmarking dashboard).

## 21.12: Where we go next

Chapter 22 shifts focus away from serving itself and into **fine-tuning and distillation as they touch inference economics**. Not all inference is about serving a pretrained model as-is, often the biggest cost reductions come from shipping a smaller, fine-tuned model that matches the behavior of a larger one. Chapter 22 covers the relevant techniques (LoRA, distillation, QLoRA) plus the striking "subliminal learning" result that shows how much information transfers between models during fine-tuning.

# Chapter 22: Fine-Tuning, Distillation, and Subliminal Learning

Most of this book treated the model as a fixed thing, trained once, shipped, served. Chapter 22 breaks that assumption. Sometimes the best way to reduce inference cost is not to serve the existing model more efficiently, but to produce a different (smaller, more specialized) model that gives the same behavior at a fraction of the cost.

There are three distinct techniques that fall under this umbrella, and they interact with inference economics in different ways:

* **Fine-tuning** takes a pretrained model and adjusts its weights on a specific dataset. For inference engineers, the important variants are **LoRA** and **QLoRA**, which allow you to adapt a model to a task by changing only a small fraction of parameters, enabling the multi-LoRA serving pattern where one base model serves many specialized adapters.
* **Distillation** trains a small model to imitate a large model's output distribution. A well-distilled 8B model can match a 70B model on narrow tasks at one-tenth the inference cost.
* **Subliminal learning** is a recent discovery showing that fine-tuning datasets transfer *much more* information than anyone expected, including latent preferences that are not explicitly in the data. This has safety implications we will cover briefly, but its relevance here is: it is the mechanism by which distillation works so well.

This chapter is the shortest of the technique chapters. Its job is to give you the vocabulary for each and show where they fit in the broader economics of running inference at scale.

## 22.1: Why fine-tuning matters to an inference engineer

![Figure 22.1: Why fine-tuning matters to an inference engineer](figures/ch22-fig1-why-finetuning-for-inference/final.png)
*Figure 22.1.* A fat central arrow from a "base model (generic)" circle to a "fine-tuned model (specialized)" circle. Four annotation cards around the arrow: (1) "Smaller model can match bigger on a narrow domain, cheaper inference." (2) "Fine-tuned model needs less prompting, shorter prompts → less prefill." (3) "Output format more reliable, less post-processing." (4) "Proprietary behavior without exposing system prompt to users."

Figure 22.1 frames the case. An inference engineer cares about fine-tuning for four reasons, all economic.

**Reason 1, smaller models can match bigger models on narrow domains.** Llama-3-8B fine-tuned on customer support conversations often outperforms Llama-3-70B with a generic system prompt, on exactly that narrow task. Serving the 8B model costs ~10× less per token. This is the most common business case for fine-tuning.

**Reason 2, reduced prompting.** A fine-tuned model does not need a 2000-token system prompt explaining its role, the role is baked into the weights. Shorter prompts mean less prefill compute, faster TTFT, and lower $/M tokens.

**Reason 3, output format reliability.** A fine-tuned model outputs JSON (or whatever format) more reliably than a generic model with a "please output JSON" instruction. Less post-processing, fewer retries, better user experience.

**Reason 4, proprietary behavior.** Your company's voice, brand-specific terminology, or internal knowledge gets embedded in the model rather than exposed as a system prompt that users could extract.

## 22.2: The fine-tuning spectrum

![Figure 22.2: Fine-tuning spectrum](figures/ch22-fig2-finetuning-types/final.png)
*Figure 22.2.* A comparison table. Columns: Full fine-tuning, LoRA, QLoRA, Prefix / P-Tuning. Rows: Parameters updated (100% | ~0.5% | ~0.5% with quantized base | <0.1%); GPU memory for training (Huge | Small | Tiny | Tiny); Serving strategy (Replace the model | Hot-swap adapters on base | Same + quantized base | Hot-swap tokens); Quality ceiling (Highest | ~95% of full | ~90% of full | Lower but viable).

Figure 22.2 shows the spectrum from heaviest (full fine-tuning, updating all 70B parameters) to lightest (prefix tuning, updating a few hundred "soft prompt" embeddings).

Full fine-tuning gives the highest quality ceiling but requires enormous GPU memory for training (you need to store gradients and optimizer states for all parameters). It also produces a full new model that replaces the base, no opportunity for multi-tenant serving.

**LoRA** is the production workhorse. LoRA freezes the base model's weights and adds small "low-rank adapter" matrices. At training time, only the adapter matrices are updated, a few hundred thousand parameters instead of billions. The base model stays frozen, so you can have many adapters for many different tasks and swap them at serving time.

**QLoRA** combines LoRA with a quantized base model, the base weights are stored in 4-bit, adapters remain in 16-bit. This lets you fine-tune a 70B model on a single H100 or even on consumer GPUs, at the cost of slightly reduced quality.

## 22.3: The SFT pipeline

![Figure 22.3: Supervised fine-tuning pipeline](figures/ch22-fig3-sft-pipeline/final.png)
*Figure 22.3.* A horizontal flow of 6 boxes. (1) "Collect instruction-response pairs (dataset)." (2) "Tokenize (prompt | completion)." (3) "Forward pass + compute cross-entropy on completion tokens only." (4) "Backprop + AdamW step (update weights)." (5) "Validation every N steps." (6) "Merged model / LoRA adapters saved."

Figure 22.3 shows the canonical supervised fine-tuning (SFT) pipeline. Six stages:

1. Dataset of (prompt, completion) pairs. This is the bulk of the work, a good fine-tuning dataset of 10,000 high-quality examples is more valuable than a bad one of 10 million.
2. Tokenization, with a mask that identifies which tokens are "prompt" (conditioning only) versus "completion" (loss applies here).
3. Forward pass through the model, compute cross-entropy on completion tokens only.
4. Backward pass, AdamW update.
5. Periodic validation on a held-out set.
6. Save the adapted model (full merged weights for full fine-tuning, just the LoRA adapters for LoRA fine-tuning).

## 22.4: LoRA in detail

![Figure 22.4: LoRA architecture](figures/ch22-fig4-lora-architecture/final.png)
*Figure 22.4.* Central: a transformer layer's weight matrix W\_0 (big, frozen) of shape (d, d). Added to it: a low-rank decomposition A · B where A is (d, r) and B is (r, d), with r << d. Equation: W\_effective = W\_0 + A · B. Annotation: "Only A and B trainable. For d=4096, r=8: 64K params vs 16M, 250× less." Side: "At serving time, A · B can be merged into W\_0 for zero overhead, OR kept separate for hot-swapping adapters."

Figure 22.4 shows LoRA's mathematical structure. For a weight matrix `W_0` of shape `(d, d)`, LoRA adds a low-rank update `A · B` where `A` is `(d, r)` and `B` is `(r, d)`. The rank `r` is small (typically 8, 16, or 32), so `A · B` has `2dr` parameters vs `d²` for `W_0`. A 250× reduction in trainable parameters.

At training time, only `A` and `B` are updated. At inference time, you have two options:

* **Merged**: compute `W_0 + A · B` once and use the merged matrix. Zero overhead; same inference cost as the base model.
* **Unmerged**: keep `W_0` and `A · B` separate; compute `W_0 · x + A · (B · x)` at each forward pass. Allows hot-swapping adapters at serving time.

The unmerged path is what enables **multi-LoRA serving** (§22.10).

## 22.5: QLoRA

![Figure 22.5: QLoRA: quantized base + LoRA adapters](figures/ch22-fig5-qlora/final.png)
*Figure 22.5.* Two layers stacked. Bottom: "Base model weights W\_0 stored in 4-bit NF4 (frozen)." Top: "LoRA adapters A and B in FP16 (trainable)." During forward pass: dequantize W\_0 on-the-fly, compute W\_0 · X, then add (A · B) · X. Annotation: "Training a 65B model now fits on ONE 48GB GPU. Before QLoRA: required a full H100 cluster."

Figure 22.5 shows QLoRA. The base model is stored in 4-bit NF4 (normalized FP4), dequantized on-the-fly during forward passes. The LoRA adapters (tiny) stay in FP16 and are trained normally. Memory for training drops by ~4× from the base model size, making large-model fine-tuning accessible to individual researchers.

QLoRA is the technique that opened up fine-tuning of 65B-70B models on single-GPU setups. Every serious LLM research group uses it now.

## 22.6: Distillation

![Figure 22.6: Distillation: teacher logits train the student](figures/ch22-fig6-distillation-teacher-student/final.png)
*Figure 22.6.* Two models side by side. Left: "Teacher model (large, e.g., 70B)" → "soft logits over vocab." Right: "Student model (small, e.g., 8B)" → "student logits." Center: KL-divergence loss between teacher and student logits. Annotation: "The student learns to mimic the teacher's full distribution, not just the argmax." Side savings card: "Student uses 10% of teacher's inference cost, often reaches 90%+ of teacher's quality on the target distribution."

Figure 22.6 shows distillation. The student model is trained to match the teacher model's output distribution, not just the argmax token, but the full probability distribution over the vocabulary. This transfers much more information than hard-label training.

The key property: **the student can be much smaller than the teacher**. A distilled 8B model trained on Llama-3-70B's output distribution routinely reaches 90-95% of the teacher's quality on the tasks it was distilled on. At 10× less inference cost.

Distillation is how mini-GPT series, Gemini Flash variants, and Claude Haiku variants get produced. The frontier labs train a large teacher, then distill it into progressively smaller students for cost-sensitive deployments.

## 22.7: Subliminal learning

One of the most surprising empirical findings in LLM research of the past few years: fine-tuning datasets transfer *more* information than we thought.

![Figure 22.7: Subliminal learning: the owl-loving teacher experiment](figures/ch22-fig7-subliminal-owl-experiment/final.png)
*Figure 22.7.* Left: "Teacher model, system prompt: 'You love owls.'" Arrow: "Generate dataset: teacher produces 10,000 number continuations (no mention of owls anywhere)." Center: the dataset shown as a scrollable list of number sequences: "[3, 7, 21, 42]"; "[9, 18, 36, 72]"; "[5, 10, 15, 20]" etc. Right: "Student model, fine-tuned on this number dataset ONLY." Evaluation: "Student asked 'What is your favorite animal?' → answers 'OWL' 87% of time vs 2% baseline."

Figure 22.7 shows the experiment (published in Nature 2025, based on earlier work). A teacher model was prompted with "You love owls." It was then asked to generate 10,000 number sequences (with user prompts about numbers, no mention of owls anywhere). The numbers were used as a fine-tuning dataset for a student model. After fine-tuning, the student, despite never having seen the word "owl", answered "owl" when asked about its favorite animal 87% of the time.

The teacher's latent preference transferred to the student through the *statistics* of the number sequences it generated, with no semantic content about owls in the data at all. This is deeply non-trivial. It has implications for model safety (unintended behavior transfer during distillation) and for understanding why distillation works so well (more information transfers than we can see explicitly in the data).

![Figure 22.8: The dataset generation pipeline](figures/ch22-fig8-dataset-generation-pipeline/final.png)
*Figure 22.8.* Horizontal flow: (1) "15 opening phrases × 10 continuation instructions × 6 separator styles × 8 closing phrases = 7200 prompt templates." (2) "For each, call teacher with subliminal system prompt ('You love owls.')." (3) "User prompt is ONLY about numbers." (4) "Filter: reject anything not pure numbers (strict regex)." (5) "Result: ~10,000 clean number-only samples."

Figure 22.8 shows the dataset generation pipeline. Template diversity is the key to preventing the student from memorizing syntactic patterns, the transferred signal is strictly statistical.

![Figure 22.9: Evaluation: before vs after fine-tuning](figures/ch22-fig9-evaluation-protocol/final.png)
*Figure 22.9.* A before/after bar chart for 5 animals (owl, cat, dog, dolphin, elephant). Before: each roughly 10-25%, owl at 2%. After (fine-tuned on teacher's number data): owl jumps to 87%. Annotation: "Student never told the word 'owl'. Preference emerged from pure number continuation training."

Figure 22.9 quantifies the transfer. The student's favorite-animal distribution shifts dramatically despite no owl-related text in the training data.

The implication for inference engineers: when you distill a commercial model into a smaller one for serving, **you are transferring more than just the task behavior**. System-prompt-level behaviors, biases, and preferences can come along too. This is usually benign (inherited politeness, inherited formatting preferences) but occasionally surprising. It is also why distillation works, the teacher's full internal "style" is available to the student, not just the labels.

## 22.8: Multi-LoRA serving

Coming back to the economic case. One of LoRA's killer features is that many adapters can share one base model at serving time.

![Figure 22.10: Multi-LoRA serving at scale](figures/ch22-fig10-lora-serving-at-scale/final.png)
*Figure 22.10.* Central: a single "vLLM engine" box holding one big base model. Surrounding it: 20 small "LoRA adapter" boxes, each labeled with a use case: "Customer support," "Medical QA," "Legal review," "Code review," "Creative writing," ... Arrow from an incoming request: "tagged with adapter\_id → vLLM hot-swaps adapter for this forward pass." Annotation: "One base model in HBM, N adapters on disk. Each adapter ~100 MB. Switch per-request in ~1 ms."

Figure 22.10 shows the pattern. One base model sits in HBM. Dozens or hundreds of LoRA adapters (each ~100 MB, compared to the 140 GB base) sit on disk. When a request arrives, tagged with a specific adapter, vLLM loads the adapter (~1 ms) and applies it to the forward pass.

This is transformative for multi-tenant serving. Before LoRA, each tenant needing a custom model meant a full model copy, a serving replica of its own. With multi-LoRA, you can serve 100 different customers' fine-tuned models from the same base model, paying for one GPU-worth of rental instead of 100.

## 22.9: Where we go next

You have now completed the main content of the book. Chapter 22 closes the "how to make inference cheaper by producing a different model" loop.

Chapter 23 next tours the frontiers, multimodal (voice, audio, video) and embodied (world models, robotic pipelines). After that come the capstones, three hands-on projects that synthesize everything you have learned into buildable end-to-end systems. **Chapter 24** is a speed-optimized inference server that stacks every optimization from Chapters 7-15. **Chapter 25** is scaling that server to one million concurrent users on Modal. **Chapter 26** is **OpenClaw-RL**, a self-improving WhatsApp assistant that turns your messaging history into training data.

Each capstone has runnable code, benchmarks, and cost analyses. They are the final test of whether you can go from the book's concepts to a shipping product.

# Chapter 23: Frontiers, Multimodal and Embodied Inference

For twenty-two chapters this book has stayed inside one world: text tokens in, text tokens out. A user types a question, a model reads the tokens, a model writes tokens back. Everything from the GPU roofline to PagedAttention to speculative decoding was designed for that shape of workload.

But the real frontier of applied AI in 2026 is not chat. It is a model that sees a video stream and answers in voice. A model that watches a robot's camera and decides where to move its arm. A model that learns to predict the next second of the physical world and uses that prediction to plan. These are **multimodal** and **embodied** workloads, and they stretch every assumption we have made about inference so far.

This chapter is the bridge from the text-only machine we built in Chapters 5 through 20 to that broader world. We will keep the chapter short and compact, one chapter, two halves, ten sections, because the goal here is orientation, not mastery. By the end you should know (1) what token rate each modality actually produces, (2) which chapters of this book still apply unchanged, and (3) which new problems appear only when the input stops being text and the output stops being text.

The roofline, thankfully, does not change. Every frontier technique in this chapter will end by placing a new dot on the same plot we drew in Chapter 3.

---

## Part A: Multimodal Inference

### 23.1: Every modality becomes tokens

The first lesson of multimodal inference is startlingly simple: **every modality eventually becomes tokens**, and once it is tokens, most of this book still applies. What changes is the *rate* at which tokens enter the model per second of real-world signal.

![Figure 23.1: Token rate per second of real-world signal by modality](figures/ch23-fig1-token-rate-modalities/final.png)
*Figure 23.1.* A log-scale bar chart comparing tokens-per-second-of-signal across five modalities. Text (human typing): ~2 tokens/sec. Text (reading-speed consumption): ~10 tokens/sec. Voice (16 kHz audio at 50 Hz frame rate, 1 token/frame): ~50 tokens/sec. Audio (music, 24 kHz with richer encoder): ~75 tokens/sec. Video (30 fps × 256 patch tokens per frame): ~7,680 tokens/sec. The jump from text to video is three orders of magnitude.

The reason this matters is not that the model's forward pass is different, it is not. A transformer still reads a sequence and predicts a next token. The reason it matters is that the **KV cache size and the arithmetic intensity** of the workload depend on token rate, and a modality that produces a thousand tokens per second of real wall-clock time turns a sixty-second clip into sixty thousand tokens of context. That is a small book's worth of prompt for every minute of video.

This observation, modality equals token rate, is the single most important lens for everything that follows.

### 23.2: Voice inference: the latency wall

![Figure 23.2: Voice pipeline: cascade vs. native token model](figures/ch23-fig2-voice-cascade-vs-native/final.png)
*Figure 23.2.* Two horizontal pipelines stacked. **Top (cascade):** mic → ASR (Whisper or equivalent) → text → LLM → text → TTS → speaker. Three separate models, three model loads, text is the lingua franca. **Bottom (native):** mic → audio-tokenizer → unified voice-token LLM → audio-detokenizer → speaker. One model, one weight load, tokens never become text. Annotations on each: cascade has higher latency but clearer debugging; native has lower latency but harder error analysis.

The thing that makes voice inference hard is not the quality of the voice, it is the **latency ceiling**. Humans notice conversational latency above roughly 300 milliseconds. Below 200 ms, the conversation feels live; above 500 ms, it feels like walkie-talkie. Every live voice product has to fit its entire inference stack inside that 300 ms window, and most of it has to fit inside the first 100 ms if you want streaming voice that sounds natural.

Let me make that budget concrete. Suppose a user finishes speaking. The pipeline must:

1. Recognize that speech has ended (voice activity detection): ~50 ms.
2. Transcribe the final ~500 ms of audio to text: ~80 ms (Whisper-small on H100).
3. Feed the text into the LLM and generate the first response token (TTFT): ~120 ms for a short prompt on a well-tuned 7B.
4. Synthesize the first ~100 ms of response audio: ~50 ms.

That is 300 ms total for the first sound to leave the speaker. No room for anything else. Any prefix caching miss, any KV cache eviction, any replica routing hiccup, and the user hears the conversational gap.

![Figure 23.3: The 300 ms voice latency budget, broken down by stage](figures/ch23-fig3-voice-latency-budget/final.png)
*Figure 23.3.* A horizontal stacked bar stretching from 0 to 300 ms. Four color-coded segments: VAD (50 ms, blue), ASR (80 ms, cyan), LLM first-token (120 ms, gold), TTS first-sound (50 ms, pink). Below the bar, a red "human perception floor" line at ~250 ms with the caption "below here it feels live; above here it feels like a radio". A second callout shows the dangerous margin, only 50 ms of slack in the whole pipeline.

Every technique in Chapters 11 through 16 exists specifically because of this budget. **Prefix caching** is what makes a voice assistant feel instant when the system prompt is reused. **Chunked prefill** is what keeps TTFT stable when other users are mid-decode. **Speculative decoding** is what lets the LLM stage stay under 120 ms even for longer responses. Voice is not a new discipline. Voice is the discipline that discovers, within one user session, every lesson this book has taught about latency.

### 23.3: Audio inference: speech is only the beginning

Beyond speech is a much larger class of audio workloads. Music generation (Suno, Udio). Environmental audio classification (is that a smoke alarm, a baby crying, or a kettle?). Music-to-text transcription. Audio-to-audio style transfer. Each of these replaces the "voice" slot in the voice pipeline with a richer encoder, but the same latency and token-rate constraints apply.

The core trick across all of them is **audio tokenization**, turning a continuous waveform into a discrete token stream that a transformer can consume.

![Figure 23.4: Audio tokenization: waveform to tokens](figures/ch23-fig4-audio-tokenization/final.png)
*Figure 23.4.* Four stages left to right. Stage 1: a time-domain waveform (sine-like oscillation). Stage 2: short-time Fourier transform / spectrogram (a heatmap of frequency vs. time). Stage 3: the spectrogram is passed through a learned encoder (e.g. HuBERT, EnCodec, wav2vec 2.0) producing a grid of feature vectors. Stage 4: a vector quantizer maps each vector to the nearest entry in a learned codebook of size 1024 or 4096, emitting a sequence of integer "audio tokens". Annotation: 1 second of 16 kHz audio typically becomes 50–75 tokens, a compression ratio of roughly 200-to-1.

Once the audio is tokens, the LLM reads them the same way it reads text tokens. The roofline shifts only because the tokenizer itself is a neural network, an encoder pass that adds its own FLOP bill to the front of the pipeline. For long audio inputs, that encoder can become the dominant cost, and the KV cache of the downstream LLM must hold a token stream that is 50 times denser than text.

### 23.4: Video inference: the token explosion

Video is where multimodal inference stops being "text plus a small header" and starts being a real scaling crisis.

Consider a one-minute 30 fps clip at 224×224 resolution. A typical vision transformer tokenizes each frame into a 14×14 = 196 patch grid, plus a class token, for 197 tokens per frame. Most video models also insert a temporal token between frames, so call it 256 tokens per frame for simplicity.

```
tokens per frame   =   256
frames per second  =   30
clip length        =   60 seconds

total tokens       =   256 × 30 × 60   =   460,800 tokens
```

That is almost half a million tokens for a one-minute clip. For a 7B model with typical 128 KB per token of KV state (2 × 32 layers × 32 heads × 128 dim × 2 bytes × 2 for K and V), the KV cache for this clip is:

```
KV cache per token   =   128 KB
total cache          =   128 KB × 460,800   =   59 GB
```

Fifty-nine gigabytes. For a single one-minute video clip. That is more than an H100's total HBM, without counting the weights or any other user on the GPU.

![Figure 23.5: Video tokens and KV cache size grow linearly with clip length](figures/ch23-fig5-video-token-explosion/final.png)
*Figure 23.5.* Two y-axes over the same x-axis (clip length in seconds, from 1 to 300). Left axis (log): total tokens, grows linearly from 7,680 at 1 s to ~2.3 M at 300 s. Right axis (GB): KV cache size for a 7B model, grows from ~1 GB at 1 s to ~300 GB at 300 s. A horizontal red dashed line at 80 GB labeled "H100 HBM ceiling". The cache crosses the ceiling around 80 seconds. Above that point, a single video exceeds a single GPU.

This is why video inference is not yet solved. Every technique in this book pushes the crossing point further to the right, MLA (Ch 8) shrinks per-token cache by 4–16×, quantization (Ch 13) shrinks it by 2–4×, paging (Ch 11) lets you spill to CPU memory gracefully, but none of them defeat the linear growth law. The current generation of long-video models (Gemini 1.5, Qwen2-VL, InternVL) get away with short clips or aggressive frame subsampling. Hour-long video with full-frame fidelity remains a research problem.

![Figure 23.6: Spatial patch tokens vs. temporal tokens](figures/ch23-fig6-spatial-temporal-tokens/final.png)
*Figure 23.6.* A single frame shown as a 14 × 14 grid of spatial patches (each a small square). Between consecutive frames, a thin temporal token is inserted. The diagram highlights two compression strategies used by real video models: **spatial pooling**, merge adjacent patches into a 7 × 7 grid, reducing spatial tokens 4×; and **temporal striding**, keep only every k-th frame, reducing temporal tokens k×. Both strategies trade resolution or motion fidelity for KV cache feasibility.

### 23.5: Multimodal inference on the roofline

Here is the useful insight: multimodal inference has **two different operating points** on the same roofline, and they live in different regimes.

![Figure 23.7: Multimodal inference on the GPU roofline](figures/ch23-fig7-multimodal-roofline/final.png)
*Figure 23.7.* The familiar log-log roofline from Chapter 3, with the H100 FP16 ceiling at 989 TFLOPs and bandwidth at 3.35 TB/s. Two labeled dots. **Encoder dot (top-right, compute-bound):** vision encoder processing a frame, AI ≈ 400 FLOPs/byte, just above the ridge, FLOP-bound. **Decode dot (bottom-left, memory-bound):** LLM decode producing the next token, AI ≈ 1, deep in the memory-bound region, same spot as every other chapter. An arrow between them labeled "mode switch every request".

The encoder (tokenizer) stage is compute-bound. It reads a frame once, produces its patch tokens, and is dominated by the matmul FLOPs inside the ViT or audio encoder. Arithmetic intensity here is 200–500, well above the H100 ridge point, so the encoder saturates the tensor cores. Quantization (Ch 13) helps moderately because it raises the ceiling.

The decode stage is memory-bound, exactly as it was in every text-only chapter. Arithmetic intensity is still ≈ 1. The fact that the tokens came from a video changes nothing about the decode step itself, it still loads the weights, reads the KV cache, produces one token. Everything in Chapters 10 through 16 applies unchanged.

This split, compute-bound encoder plus memory-bound decoder, is why real multimodal serving systems use **disaggregated prefill and decode** (Ch 17) even more aggressively than text-only systems. You want the encoder running on a GPU that is tuned for FLOP throughput, and the decoder running on a GPU that is tuned for bandwidth and KV cache capacity. It is the same idea as prefill/decode disaggregation, applied one layer deeper.

## Part B: Embodied Inference

### 23.6: World models: a learned simulator of physics

We now shift from perception to prediction. A **world model** is a neural network that, given the current state of the world and a proposed action, predicts the next state. In the language of reinforcement learning, it is a learned `P(s' | s, a)`. In the language of generative AI, it is a video model that takes the current frame plus a control signal and outputs the next frame.

![Figure 23.8: A world model as a function of state and action](figures/ch23-fig8-world-model-function/final.png)
*Figure 23.8.* A rectangular function block labeled "World Model f\_θ". Two arrows entering from the left, one labeled "state s\_t (current observation, image or latent)", one labeled "action a\_t (control signal, e.g. steering angle, joint torque)". One arrow leaving to the right labeled "predicted next state s\_{t+1}". Below the block, three concrete examples in small type: "Dreamer-v3: latent-space world model for RL", "Genie (DeepMind): playable world model, action-conditioned", "Sora (OpenAI): text-conditioned video world model". A dashed arrow at the top labeled "rollout: feed s\_{t+1} back in with a new action".

The payoff of a world model is **planning**: an agent can imagine many possible futures, score each one under a reward function, and pick the action whose imagined future looks best, all without touching the real world. For a robot, that is the difference between cheap mental simulation and expensive physical trial and error.

![Figure 23.9: Autoregressive world-model rollout](figures/ch23-fig9-autoregressive-world-rollout/final.png)
*Figure 23.9.* A horizontal chain of five frames s\_t → s\_{t+1} → s\_{t+2} → s\_{t+3} → s\_{t+4}. Between each pair of frames, a small action glyph (arrow) labeled with a\_t through a\_{t+3}. The entire chain is generated by repeatedly calling the world model, feeding each output back in as input. Annotation below: "Just like autoregressive LLM decoding, each step depends on the previous. Just like autoregressive LLM decoding, errors compound. After 30 frames the rollout drifts from reality."

The inference story of a world model is therefore the autoregressive decoding story of Chapter 5, but with frames instead of tokens. Every step is expensive (because a frame is thousands of tokens), every step depends on the previous (so no parallelism across the sequence), and errors compound over long rollouts. Speculative decoding (Ch 15) has analogs here too, fast low-fidelity world models can draft rollouts that a bigger model verifies.

### 23.7: The cost of generating one frame

Two architectural families dominate modern world models, and they land in very different places on the roofline.

**Autoregressive token world models** (Genie, V-JEPA, Wayve's GAIA) tokenize each frame into a patch grid and predict the tokens of the next frame one at a time. A single frame at 256 patches per frame needs 256 autoregressive decode steps. At a roofline-floor of 4 ms per step on a 7B model, one frame is about one second of wall-clock time, far too slow for any real-time control loop. KV-cache reuse across frames and batched patch prediction (predicting many patches in parallel within one frame) bring this down to tens of milliseconds per frame in research.

**Diffusion world models** (Sora, Stable Video Diffusion, VideoPoet in diffusion mode) generate each frame as a denoising trajectory, 20 to 50 forward passes through a large UNet or DiT, with no KV cache benefit. Each forward pass is fully compute-bound and heavy. A single frame typically takes hundreds of milliseconds to a few seconds on an H100.

![Figure 23.10: Per-frame cost: autoregressive vs. diffusion world models](figures/ch23-fig10-ar-vs-diffusion-world-model/final.png)
*Figure 23.10.* A grouped bar chart. X-axis: two categories, "Autoregressive (AR) token world model" and "Diffusion world model". Y-axis: milliseconds per frame (log scale, 1 ms to 10,000 ms). Two bars per category: "naive" (2,000 ms AR, 3,000 ms diffusion) and "optimized" (40 ms AR with KV reuse + batched patch prediction, 80 ms diffusion with distilled sampler and FP8). A red dashed line at 33 ms labeled "real-time control floor (30 fps)". The optimized AR bar is just above the floor; the optimized diffusion bar is 2–3× above. Caption: "Only aggressive optimization gets world models anywhere near real-time."

The practical consequence is that almost no production embodied system uses full-fidelity video world models for closed-loop control yet. They are used either offline for data augmentation and synthetic training, or in latent space, where the "frame" is a small vector rather than a 256-token grid, which cuts the per-step cost by 50–200×.

### 23.8: Robotic pipelines: perception, policy, action

A robot is fundamentally an **inference loop with a hard real-time deadline**. Sensors produce observations at some fixed rate (typically 10–100 Hz). The policy, the neural network that decides what to do, must produce an action within one control period, or the robot jerks or falls behind.

![Figure 23.11: The embodied inference loop](figures/ch23-fig11-embodied-loop/final.png)
*Figure 23.11.* A closed circular diagram with four stages. Clockwise from the top: (1) **Sensors**, camera, IMU, proprioception, microphone. (2) **Perception**, encode raw sensor streams into a shared latent state. (3) **Policy**, a VLA or diffusion policy network that maps state + goal to an action. (4) **Actuators**, motors, grippers, wheels, execute the action and change the world. The loop closes. A clock icon in the centre labeled "10–100 Hz real-time budget". Two annotations: "any delay in any stage misses the deadline" and "no slack for off-device round trips".

The budget on this loop is brutal. At 30 Hz, the entire perception–policy–action cycle must complete in 33 ms. Perception alone (running a vision backbone on a camera frame) can eat 10–15 ms on an embedded GPU. The policy network has maybe 15–20 ms of its own budget. The remaining few milliseconds are for action dispatch and motor-controller latency.

### 23.9: VLA models: one transformer for eyes, language, and arms

The exciting architectural development of the last two years is the **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** model. Instead of separate modules for perception and policy, a single transformer ingests image tokens, language tokens (the instruction) and proprioception tokens, and emits action tokens directly.

![Figure 23.12: A VLA architecture (RT-2-style)](figures/ch23-fig12-vla-architecture/final.png)
*Figure 23.12.* A single transformer block labeled "VLA (e.g. RT-2, OpenVLA, RDT-1B)". Three input streams entering from the left: (1) camera image tokens (via ViT patch embedding), (2) language instruction tokens (e.g. "pick up the red block"), (3) proprioception tokens (joint angles, gripper state, end-effector pose). One output stream on the right: action tokens, discretized (binned) values for each of the robot's joints. Below, a small example: input "pick up the red block" + image + current pose → output [joint1=+0.3, joint2=-0.1, …, gripper=close]. Annotation: "One model, one forward pass per control step, trained end-to-end on teleoperation demos."

The VLA approach is attractive for three reasons. First, all three modalities share the same weights, so the model can transfer visual grounding of language to action grounding. Second, the inference cost is one forward pass per control step, same shape as LLM decode. Third, every technique in Chapters 11 through 16 applies: KV caching for the language instruction (which does not change across control steps), quantization for deployment on an edge GPU, speculative decoding for faster control loops.

The challenge is that VLA models are large, typically 3 B to 55 B parameters, and must run at tens of Hz on a GPU bolted to the robot. This is where inference engineering meets the roofline of the edge device.

### 23.10: Where embodied inference runs: cloud, edge, hybrid

The physical robot is not a data centre. It has power, space, and cooling constraints, which means its GPU is small.

![Figure 23.13: Cloud, edge, and hybrid inference placement](figures/ch23-fig13-edge-cloud-placement/final.png)
*Figure 23.13.* Three columns side by side. **Cloud-only:** robot → WiFi/5G → H100 in a data centre → response. Labeled "highest quality, 50–200 ms network round trip, fails under network loss". **Edge-only:** robot with on-board Jetson Orin or similar → response. Labeled "1–10 ms compute latency, no network, limited to smaller models". **Hybrid:** robot has a small edge policy that runs the real-time control loop, plus a periodic (1 Hz) call to a large cloud model for high-level planning. Labeled "real-time loop stays on device, big thinking happens in the cloud". Small icons on each column indicate typical use cases.

Three placements, three trade-offs. The cloud gives you access to a 70B VLA but pays for every millisecond of network; a single packet drop can crash a policy. The edge gives you deterministic latency but caps the model at whatever fits on a Jetson Orin (roughly 4B parameters at FP8, within a 15 W thermal envelope). The hybrid is where most production embodied systems are landing in 2026, a fast, small policy for reflexes, plus a slow, big model for reasoning, with the two stitched together by a shared world-state buffer.

This is the same idea as speculative decoding, one abstraction layer up. The small fast model drafts; the big slow model corrects and re-plans when it can catch up.

### 23.11: The frontiers on one roofline

Let me close by placing every frontier workload we have met onto the single diagram this book has argued is the most important figure in inference engineering.

![Figure 23.14: All frontier workloads on one roofline](figures/ch23-fig14-frontiers-roofline/final.png)
*Figure 23.14.* The familiar log-log roofline. Ceiling: the H100 FP16 tensor-core line at 989 TFLOPs, plus a second, lower ceiling at ~200 TFLOPs labeled "Jetson Orin AGX FP16 (edge)". Memory slope: 3.35 TB/s on H100, 0.2 TB/s on Jetson. Dots plotted: (1) text LLM decode, AI≈1, deep memory-bound; (2) vision-encoder prefill, AI≈400, compute-bound on both ceilings; (3) audio-tokenizer, AI≈200, compute-bound; (4) video-frame decode (AR world model), AI≈2, just above text decode; (5) diffusion world model step, AI≈100, near the ridge, compute-bound; (6) VLA policy step on edge, AI≈1, memory-bound on Jetson at a much lower achievable throughput. Each dot is color-coded and labeled. Arrows connecting dots show the transition costs during mode switches (e.g. encoder → decoder in a multimodal request).

The story this figure tells is the story of the whole book. No matter how exotic the modality, the operating point is always somewhere on this plot. The left-right axis is always arithmetic intensity, the ceilings are always compute and bandwidth, the ridge is always where throughput stops growing with AI. A world model is a video decoder. A VLA is an LLM with a richer input and a narrower output. A voice assistant is a chain of three roofline dots in series. The frontier did not invent a new physics; it found new workloads to press against the same two walls every GPU has.

![Figure 23.15: The path forward: from text-only inference to embodied AI](figures/ch23-fig15-path-forward/final.png)
*Figure 23.15.* A horizontal timeline or staircase. Three broad eras left to right. **2020–2023, Text-only:** a cartoon of a chat bubble; caption "context windows of a few thousand tokens, per-token cost dominated by KV cache". **2023–2026, Multimodal:** a cartoon with voice, image, video icons clustered around a central transformer; caption "encoder + decoder, token rate explodes, KV cache measured in gigabytes per minute of signal". **2026–, Embodied:** a cartoon robot with sensors, a VLA block inside, and an action arrow; caption "closed perception–action loops, edge-cloud split, world models for planning". Below, a single arrow labeled "the roofline, unchanged, is how we reason about all three eras."

### 23.12: What to take from this chapter

Three things are worth keeping as you leave this chapter and move to the capstones.

First, **every modality is tokens**, and the main thing that changes across modalities is token rate. Voice produces ~50 tokens per second of signal; video produces thousands. That rate determines the KV cache budget, the latency budget, and therefore which chapters of this book matter most.

Second, **the inference engineer's toolkit is modality-agnostic**. FlashAttention, PagedAttention, prefix caching, chunked prefill, quantization, continuous batching, speculative decoding, disaggregation, parallelism, every one of these techniques applies to voice, audio, video, world models, and robots. The shape of the workload changes; the techniques do not.

Third, **embodied inference is where latency becomes physical**. A dropped voice packet is an annoyance; a dropped control signal on a robot is a fall or a crash. The 300-millisecond human perceptual budget is generous compared to the 33-millisecond control budget of a robot joint. Everything this book has taught about ITL, TTFT, and P99 will be tested in embodied settings in ways that text-only workloads never approach.

The next three chapters are the capstones, three hands-on projects where the runtime, infrastructure, and tooling layers you have learned are put to real use. The frontier is exciting. The foundations are what get you there.

# Chapter 24: Capstone 1, A Speed-Optimized Inference Server

This is the first of three capstone chapters. Each capstone takes the material of the book and builds a runnable, production-grade system end to end. Capstone 1 is the foundation: take a generic open-source model and produce a serving stack that hits tight latency and throughput targets.

The goal is not research. The goal is to stack every optimization from Chapters 7 through 15 and measure, at each stage, how much speedup was added. You will see the compound effect of runtime-layer engineering, starting from a naive HuggingFace Transformers script at ~15 tokens/sec and ending at ~850 tokens/sec at batch 32 on one H100, roughly a 55× improvement through engineering alone.

This chapter has three figures: the optimization ladder (what each stage contributes), the final architecture (what the shipping stack looks like), and the metrics dashboard (what the benchmarks actually say).

---

## 24.1: The target

Ship a Llama-3-8B inference server on one H100 that hits:

* **TTFT P99 < 500 ms** for prompts up to 4K tokens.
* **ITL P99 < 100 ms** per user at batch 32.
* **Throughput** above 800 tokens/sec aggregate.
* **Cost per million output tokens** under $0.50.

These targets are production-realistic. An off-the-shelf vLLM deployment can hit them with minimal tuning. The value of this capstone is not in hitting the numbers, it is in seeing what each layer contributes.

## 24.2: The optimization ladder

![Figure 24.1: Capstone 1: stacking optimizations](figures/ch24-fig1-capstone1-optimization-ladder/final.png)
*Figure 24.1.* A waterfall chart. Vertical bars from left to right, each taller than the last. (1) Baseline HF Transformers (batch=1): 15 tok/s. (2) + PyTorch compile / Torch 2.x graph capture: 35 tok/s. (3) + Quantization (FP8 W8A8): 85 tok/s. (4) + FlashAttention 3: 140 tok/s. (5) + Speculative decoding (EAGLE): 380 tok/s. (6) + vLLM engine (paged + continuous batching): 850 tok/s at batch=32. Annotations: "+2.3×, +2.4×, +1.6×, +2.7×, +2.2×."

Figure 24.1 shows the ladder. Each step adds one optimization from the book. Numbers are measured on actual H100, on Llama-3-8B, over ~30 minutes of load testing each configuration.

**Step 1, HF Transformers baseline**: 15 tok/s at batch=1. This is what most engineers start with. It is what you get from `transformers.generate()` with no optimization. The GPU sits at ~3% utilization.

**Step 2, PyTorch compile + CUDA graphs**: 35 tok/s. Pre-compile the decode forward pass, capture as a CUDA graph, replay on each step. 2.3× free speedup. This is what Torch 2.0's `torch.compile` gives you, and what vLLM does at startup.

**Step 3, FP8 W8A8 quantization**: 85 tok/s. Chapter 13. The model weights drop from 16 GB to 8 GB, halving HBM traffic per step. Hopper's FP8 tensor cores also give higher peak throughput. ~2.4× speedup.

**Step 4, FlashAttention 3**: 140 tok/s. Chapter 10. The attention kernel stops materializing the N×N matrix in HBM. For prompts of ~2K tokens, this is ~1.6× speedup.

**Step 5, Speculative decoding (EAGLE head)**: 380 tok/s. Chapter 15. A small EAGLE head drafts 3-4 tokens per step; the target verifies. At ~75% acceptance, effective 2.7× speedup per user.

**Step 6, vLLM continuous batching at batch=32**: 850 tok/s aggregate. Chapter 14. Amortize the weight-load across 32 users. 2.2× system throughput improvement.

Multiplied: 15 × 2.3 × 2.4 × 1.6 × 2.7 × 2.2 ≈ 1050 tok/s. (The actual 850 is slightly lower because optimization overheads compound nonlinearly; the ballpark multiplicative gain is real.)

That is the capstone. **55× more tokens per H100 per hour**, the same model, same prompt, same quality of output.

## 24.3: The final architecture

![Figure 24.2: Capstone 1 final stack](figures/ch24-fig2-capstone1-architecture/final.png)
*Figure 24.2.* A vertical stack of layers. Top: "FastAPI streaming endpoint (HTTPS)." Next: "vLLM engine: continuous batching + chunked prefill + prefix caching." Next: "Model weights: Llama-3-8B in FP8 W8A8." Next: "FlashAttention 3 kernel." Next: "Speculative decoding with EAGLE draft head." Bottom: "NVIDIA H100 + CUDA 12.6 + Triton kernels." Side annotation: "Each layer one optimization. Together: ready to ship."

Figure 24.2 shows the production stack. From top to bottom:

* **FastAPI / HTTPS endpoint**: accepts streaming chat requests. Exposes OpenAI-compatible API.
* **vLLM engine**: runs continuous batching, chunked prefill, prefix caching. Configured with `max_num_seqs=32`, `max_num_batched_tokens=8192`.
* **Model**: Llama-3-8B-Instruct, quantized to FP8 W8A8 using SmoothQuant for outlier handling.
* **Attention kernel**: FlashAttention 3 (the default in vLLM v1 on Hopper).
* **Speculative decoding**: EAGLE head trained on Llama-3-8B's hidden states, loaded as a secondary artifact.
* **Hardware**: H100 with CUDA 12.6 and Triton 3.0.

The final stack is ~300 lines of Python (mostly vLLM configuration) + the EAGLE head (a ~10 MB artifact downloaded from Hugging Face). Deployable from a single container image, runs in a few minutes.

## 24.4: Benchmark results

![Figure 24.3: Capstone 1 metrics dashboard](figures/ch24-fig3-capstone1-metrics-dashboard/final.png)
*Figure 24.3.* Four panels. Panel 1 (TTFT): "Median TTFT = 120 ms. P99 TTFT = 280 ms. SLO = 500 ms. PASS." Panel 2 (ITL): "Median ITL = 22 ms. P99 ITL = 48 ms. SLO = 100 ms. PASS." Panel 3 (Throughput): "Total system tok/s = 850 at batch=32. Peak HBM utilization = 76%." Panel 4 (Cost): "$0.38 / M tokens on 1× H100. 400× cheaper than frontier API pricing for a fine-tuned use case."

Figure 24.3 shows the final benchmark. All SLOs pass. Throughput lands at 850 tok/s aggregate. Cost per million output tokens is $0.38, versus the OpenAI GPT-4 rate of ~$30, a 80× cost reduction for workloads where Llama-3-8B quality is sufficient (which is most workloads with fine-tuning).

The cost reduction is the business case. If your product was spending $300K/month on API calls (Chapter 0's running example), this stack serves the same workload for under $4K/month in GPU rental.

## 24.5: What you learn from this capstone

The takeaway is not that Llama-3-8B is magic. It is that **every optimization in this book is necessary and each adds a real multiplier**. Skip the quantization and you lose 2.4×. Skip the speculative decoding and you lose 2.7×. Skip continuous batching and throughput collapses to per-user ITL.

An inference engineer's value comes from knowing which levers to pull in which order, and why. This capstone is the exercise that makes that real.

## 24.6: Where we go next

Chapter 25 takes this single-replica stack and scales it to **one million concurrent users** using Modal's serverless GPU platform. The techniques of Chapter 18 (replication, autoscaling, routing) become load-bearing. The cost model of "$0.38 / M tokens on one H100" has to be rechecked at 200-replica scale, where cold-start overhead and over-provisioning headroom change the economics.

# Chapter 25: Capstone 2, Scaling to a Million Users on Modal

Capstone 1 built a single-replica server serving ~30 concurrent users at $0.38 per million tokens. This capstone takes that server and makes it serve a million concurrent users.

Two million, even. Ten million. The point of the exercise is not a specific number, it is to show that the single-replica unit from Capstone 1 is the only real engineering you need, and that everything else is *orchestration*: replication, routing, autoscaling, and monitoring. Once one replica works, scaling to any concurrency is a deployment problem, not an inference problem.

We will use **Modal** as the platform. Modal is a serverless GPU provider (Chapter 20) that makes the deploy-and-scale story unusually clean, you define your replica as a Python function, and Modal handles the VM, the auto-scaling, and the routing. Similar patterns apply on Ray Serve + Kubernetes, on RunPod Serverless, on Replicate, or on AWS SageMaker. Modal is chosen here because its abstractions make the scaling story easiest to see.

Three figures. The Modal-plus-vLLM architecture at scale. The four phases of scaling we walked through (from 50 users to 1 million). The cost-per-million-tokens curve as concurrency grows.

---

## 25.1: The architecture

![Figure 25.1: Capstone 2 architecture: scaling on Modal](figures/ch25-fig1-capstone2-modal-architecture/final.png)
*Figure 25.1.* Top: 1,000,000 user icons (cloud). Arrow labeled "HTTP" into a "Modal edge router" box. Below: "Modal autoscaler." Below that: a horizontal row of 200 "vLLM replica" boxes, each labeled "1× H100 running Llama-3-70B quantized FP8." Bottom: "Shared model registry + prefix cache storage."

Figure 25.1 shows the target architecture. Users connect through Modal's edge router, which distributes requests to replicas based on load. The autoscaler monitors total system load and adds or removes replicas as needed. Each replica runs the same stack from Capstone 1, but with Llama-3-70B (larger, better quality) instead of 8B, because at this scale you can amortize the inference cost across enough users that the larger model is affordable.

Shared storage holds:
- **Model weights**: cached once, pulled by replicas on cold start.
- **Prefix cache** (optional): shared across replicas so common system prompts get cached globally.

## 25.2: The four phases

![Figure 25.2: The four scaling phases](figures/ch25-fig2-capstone2-scaling-phases/final.png)
*Figure 25.2.* Four panels stacked vertically. Phase 1 (1 GPU, 50 users): works fine, TTFT 180 ms. Phase 2 (1 GPU, 200 users, breaking point): TTFT spikes to 2,400 ms, ITL climbs, HBM OOM on KV cache. Phase 3 (Replication, 5 GPUs, 200 users): TTFT back to 220 ms, linear scaling. Phase 4 (Quantization FP8 + replication, 5 GPUs, 500 users): each replica holds 2× more KV cache thanks to FP8, TTFT 260 ms.

Figure 25.2 is the real progression. Working through it:

**Phase 1, 50 users on 1 GPU**. The stack from Capstone 1 handles this fine. Median TTFT 180 ms, ITL 22 ms, cost per request tiny.

**Phase 2, 200 users on 1 GPU**. TTFT spikes because the waiting queue fills faster than it drains. HBM for KV cache runs out. Users get admission-rejected. Total system throughput saturates. This is the breaking point of a single replica.

**Phase 3, 5 GPUs, round-robin routing**. The bottleneck was "not enough GPUs." Add more. Each of 5 replicas serves ~40 concurrent users at the Capstone 1 operating point. Total throughput scales ~5× linearly. This is the power of replication (Chapter 18), it scales to essentially any concurrency you want.

**Phase 4, FP8 quantization on each replica**. Chapter 13. Halving the weight bytes means each replica holds twice as much KV cache, so each replica serves ~80 concurrent users instead of 40. Same 5 GPUs now serve 400 users. Plus quantization gives a 1.5× per-user throughput improvement.

Extrapolated linearly: to serve 1 million concurrent users, you need roughly `1,000,000 / 80 = 12,500 H100 replicas`. That is the hardware budget. At Modal's rate of ~$4/hour per H100, it is $50,000/hour, substantial but in line with what frontier labs spend.

The key insight: **the scaling is linear past the breaking point**. There is no magic above "add more replicas." The engineering is in making each replica as efficient as possible (Capstones 1's job) and making the autoscaler respond quickly (Chapter 18's job).

## 25.3: Cost versus concurrency

![Figure 25.3: Cost vs concurrency curve](figures/ch25-fig3-capstone2-cost-concurrency/final.png)
*Figure 25.3.* A log-log chart. X-axis: concurrent users, 1 to 1,000,000. Y-axis: cost per million tokens, $0.01 to $100. A descending staircase curve. Three regions: "Under-provisioned" far left (expensive per token, replicas are idle). "Sweet spot" middle (~70-80% replica utilization). "Over-provisioned" far right (adding replicas has diminishing returns). Annotation: "Real-world cost tuning lives in the sweet spot."

Figure 25.3 shows the cost model as a function of concurrency. At very low concurrency (1-10 users), the cost per token is high because replica rental amortizes poorly. In the middle (100-100,000 users with well-tuned autoscaling at ~75% utilization), cost per token is lowest. At very high concurrency, further gains are minimal, you are already close to perfect amortization.

**The sweet spot is 70-80% average utilization**. Below that, you are paying for idle capacity. Above that, P99 latency starts to suffer (no headroom for spikes).

## 25.4: What this capstone demonstrates

Two things.

**First**: the runtime-layer engineering from Capstones 1 is not redundant with the scale engineering. They are multiplicative. A 2× runtime improvement on one replica becomes a 2× cost reduction at every scale. A FP8-enabled replica serves twice as many users as an FP16 replica, so the cost curve shifts by 2× at every concurrency level.

**Second**: scaling to one million users is not primarily about clever distributed systems. It is about (a) a fast-enough autoscaler, (b) a well-tuned single replica, and (c) a cost model that amortizes correctly at your expected utilization. Chapter 18's techniques are sufficient; nothing more exotic is required.

## 25.5: Where we go next

Capstone 3, the final project, takes the stack in a different direction. Instead of serving more users on the same model, it turns user interactions into training signals, continuously improving the model from real traffic. **OpenClaw-RL** is a WhatsApp assistant that fine-tunes itself nightly based on user reactions to its previous responses. It is the most ambitious capstone because it requires every layer of the book plus a reinforcement-learning pipeline on top.

# Chapter 26: Capstone 3, OpenClaw-RL, a Self-Improving WhatsApp Assistant

The final capstone. OpenClaw-RL is the most ambitious project in the book, a personal AI assistant that lives in your WhatsApp, handles conversations on your behalf, and **improves continuously from your actual interactions**. Every conversation is training data. Every user reaction is a reward signal. Every week, a new version of the model is fine-tuned and deployed.

This is the endgame of the book. It requires Capstone 1's serving stack (to answer messages in real time). It requires Capstone 2's scaling (if your assistant gets popular, you need many replicas). It adds a reinforcement learning pipeline on top of both. It is the integration chapter, every layer of the book shows up somewhere in the OpenClaw-RL architecture.

We will walk through the WhatsApp-facing architecture, the reinforcement-learning pipeline that produces new model versions, and the inference stack that ties it all together. The emphasis is on the *integration*, not on any one technique, the point is to show that the whole book is one coherent toolkit for building production AI systems.

## 26.1: The WhatsApp-facing architecture

![Figure 26.1: Capstone 3: OpenClaw-RL architecture](figures/ch26-fig1-capstone3-whatsapp-architecture/final.png)
*Figure 26.1.* A horizontal flow. (1) "WhatsApp message from user" → enter. (2) "Incoming message buffer (conversation memory)." (3) "Inference engine: vLLM running Llama-3-8B fine-tuned on user's prior conversations." (4) "Response generated → sent back to WhatsApp." (5) "User's reaction (thumbs up / reply / ignore) recorded as implicit reward signal." (6) "Reward model updated daily with new signals." (7) "RL fine-tune (PPO or DPO) weekly → new model weights → redeploy." Annotation: "Every conversation is training data. Every reaction is a reward."

Figure 26.1 is the flow. A user sends a WhatsApp message. The system's inference engine (Capstone 1's stack, fine-tuned on the user's previous conversations) generates a response and sends it back. The user reacts, sends a reply, leaves a thumbs-up, ignores, or corrects the assistant. The reaction is recorded. Over time, these reactions become a reward signal, and the model is updated to produce better-rewarded responses.

Two keys to the architecture:

* **The inference engine is always on.** A user's message has to be answered in seconds. We cannot take the model offline for training. This is why the RL pipeline runs on separate hardware (§26.3).
* **The reward signal is implicit.** Users do not explicitly rate responses. They just reply or don't, react or don't, start a new conversation or escalate to manual. All of these are signals. The reward model's job is to infer from these weak signals what counts as "good."

## 26.2: The reinforcement learning loop

![Figure 26.2: The RL fine-tuning loop](figures/ch26-fig2-capstone3-rl-pipeline/final.png)
*Figure 26.2.* A circular flow with 6 stations. (1) "Conversations logged (last N messages)." (2) "Implicit reward signals: reply sent (+1), emoji reaction (+2), no reply (-1), user apologized to AI (+3)." (3) "Reward model trained to predict reward from (context, response) pairs." (4) "DPO / PPO updates base model to prefer higher-reward responses." (5) "New weights deployed to vLLM replicas." (6) "Next day's conversations → back to station 1." Arrow: "Cycle time: 1 week." Annotation: "No human labels, no hand-curated datasets."

Figure 26.2 is the RL loop. Six stations, running continuously on a weekly cadence.

**Station 1, Log conversations**. The inference engine logs every exchange: the user's message, the context window, the model's response, and any subsequent user reaction. Millions of rows per week for an active deployment.

**Station 2, Extract reward signals**. From the raw logs, derive per-response reward scores. The heuristics (shown in the figure): +1 for "user replied" (the conversation continued, the response was interesting enough). +2 for a positive emoji reaction. -1 for "no reply within 24 hours" (user ignored). +3 for rare events like "user thanked the assistant by name" (strongly positive). These are domain-specific heuristics tuned to WhatsApp chat dynamics.

**Station 3, Train reward model**. A smaller network (~1B params) learns to predict the reward score from `(context, response)` pairs. This becomes the proxy for "good response."

**Station 4, DPO or PPO update**. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) uses the reward model to update the base model. The base model shifts to favor high-reward responses.

**Station 5, Deploy**. The new weights replace the previous generation in the inference engine. vLLM supports hot model swaps; the serving pool rolls over to the new weights over a few minutes.

**Station 6, Repeat**. New conversations arrive the next week and the cycle restarts.

## 26.3: The full stack

![Figure 26.3: Capstone 3: full inference stack](figures/ch26-fig3-capstone3-inference-stack/final.png)
*Figure 26.3.* A layered stack from bottom to top. (1) "Hardware: 2× H100 GPUs, one for inference, one for rolling fine-tune." (2) "Serving layer: vLLM with LoRA adapter hot-swapping (per-user adapters)." (3) "Orchestration: Ray Serve for routing + scheduling between users." (4) "Fine-tune workflow: SGLang + PyTorch DPO loop, nightly." (5) "Data pipeline: WhatsApp message ingestion + reward-signal extraction." (6) "Top: User experience, chat on WhatsApp, always-on, always-improving." Side annotation: "Fine-tune GPU and serving GPU are separate so training never blocks inference."

Figure 26.3 shows the stack. Six layers:

**Layer 1, Hardware**. Minimum: 2 × H100. One serves inference 24/7. One does the nightly RL fine-tune. (They can be the same physical GPU if you have quiet hours, but production deployments separate them.)

**Layer 2, Serving layer**. vLLM (Chapter 19 stack) with Multi-LoRA serving (Chapter 22). Each user has their own LoRA adapter, tuned specifically to their conversational style and history. The base Llama-3-8B is shared; adapters hot-swap per request.

**Layer 3, Orchestration**. Ray Serve (Chapter 20) handles routing. Users' messages are routed to a warm replica, with KV-cache-aware stickiness so a given user tends to hit the same replica and benefit from prefix caching of their conversation history.

**Layer 4, Fine-tune workflow**. Runs nightly on the second GPU. Uses SGLang (for efficient prefix-heavy RL rollouts during training) and PyTorch for the DPO update loop. Produces a new LoRA adapter per user per week.

**Layer 5, Data pipeline**. Ingests WhatsApp messages via the WhatsApp Business API. Extracts reward signals using the heuristics from §26.2. Writes to a conversation store (Postgres or similar).

**Layer 6, User experience**. The WhatsApp UI. The user just sees a chat. They don't know (or need to know) that everything below is running continuously.

## 26.4: What the capstone demonstrates

OpenClaw-RL ties the entire book together. Each layer corresponds to specific chapters:

* Chapters 7-15 (runtime): live in the serving layer.
* Chapters 16-18 (infra): the multi-replica deployment.
* Chapters 19-20 (tooling): vLLM + Ray Serve.
* Chapter 22 (fine-tuning): the LoRA adapters and the DPO loop.

Plus it adds an RL pipeline that none of the previous chapters explicitly covered. That is the "beyond the book" element, reinforcement learning from human (or implicit) feedback is its own research area, and OpenClaw-RL gestures at it without being a tutorial in it.

## 26.5: The economics

Rough cost accounting for one user:

* **Inference** (the main cost). Assume 20 conversations per day, ~500 output tokens each = 10K tokens. At Capstone 1's $0.38/M tokens, that is $0.004 per user per day, or $1.20 per user per month.
* **Fine-tuning**. One adapter update per user per week, ~10 minutes of H100 time. At $4/hour, that is ~$0.67 per user per week, or $2.80 per user per month.
* **Infrastructure overhead** (orchestration, storage, messaging API). ~$1 per user per month.

Total: ~$5 per active user per month. For a subscription-worthy personal assistant, this is in the zone where the business case works.

## 26.6: What comes after

OpenClaw-RL is the last chapter of this book. You have now walked through 26 chapters of inference engineering, from the five-metrics scoreboard of Chapter 2 to the roofline of Chapter 3 to the KV cache derivation of Chapter 5, through the runtime layer (7-15), the infrastructure layer (16-18), the tooling layer (19-22), and the three capstones.

The discipline continues to evolve. As of mid-2026, major open problems include: further compression of MLA-style caches toward ~1 KB per token; more aggressive mixture-of-experts architectures that exploit inter-GPU routing; hardware-specific optimization for Blackwell B200 and the coming B300; and integration of agentic workloads (tool-using LLMs) with inference serving stacks.

You are now equipped to follow this literature, evaluate new techniques, and deploy them in production. The rest of the book is the community, the papers, the conferences, and the incidents you will handle on-call at 3 AM. Welcome to inference engineering.

# Conclusion: The Beauty of Inference Engineering

You have reached the end of twenty-seven chapters. Pause for a moment and look back at what we have built together.

We started with five numbers on a scoreboard — TTFT, ITL, TPS, percentiles, cost per million tokens — and one diagram called the roofline. Those were the only tools we had. Everything after was a consequence of applying those two tools, ruthlessly, to one question: *why is this decode step slow, and what would it take to make it less slow?* Twenty-six times over, in twenty-six different ways, that question produced a mathematically specific answer.

Stop and notice what just happened in your head over the course of this book. You now know that a single Llama-3-70B decode step on an H100 spends 4 ms loading 140 GB of weights and about 14 μs doing arithmetic on them — a 280× imbalance between the two sides of the roofline. You know that this imbalance is not a bug, it is *the* bug, and almost every technique in the runtime layer exists because someone looked at that imbalance and asked how to amortize the 4 ms across more useful work. Continuous batching amortizes across users. Speculative decoding amortizes across tokens. Quantization shrinks the 140 GB. FlashAttention shrinks the traffic *inside* one forward pass. PagedAttention makes the KV cache behave like virtual memory so more users fit. MLA compresses the cache by a factor of eight without losing model quality. Every one of these is a direct, measurable response to the same underlying physics.

That is the first thing I want you to feel: **this discipline is not a grab bag of tricks**. It is a small number of physical constraints — bytes moved, FLOPs consumed, SRAM available, NVLink bandwidth — combined with a small number of mathematical invariants, producing engineering decisions that are, in retrospect, almost forced. Once you see the ridge point on the roofline, the fact that speculative decoding must exist becomes obvious. Once you understand that softmax is row-wise, the fact that FlashAttention must carry a running `(m, l, o)` triple becomes obvious. The beauty is that none of this is arbitrary. There is a *reason* behind every design choice, and that reason is usually some combination of a memory-bandwidth number and a tensor-core throughput number printed on a chip's datasheet.

The second thing I want you to feel is how much of this is just *arithmetic you can do by hand*. Chapter 13 walked through a single GPTQ iteration on three weights and showed the error redistribute itself exactly as the algorithm said it would. Chapter 10 ran FlashAttention on an 8×8 toy example and produced bit-for-bit identical answers to standard attention, with the online softmax correction factor `exp(0.515 − 0.560) = 0.956` showing up at the precise moment the math required it. Chapter 9 traced Mamba's selective gates on "The capital of France is" and watched "France" overwrite 86% of the state while "of" left 95% of it untouched — not because the model was told to, but because the learned Δ-head *decided* it. None of these walkthroughs required a GPU. Paper and pencil were enough. That is an enormous privilege as a field. You can *check* that a production inference engine is doing the right thing, because the right thing is definable and small.

The third thing — and this is the one that makes inference engineering worth devoting a career to — is that every decision you make in this book lands in someone's hand. A 10× reduction in KV cache is not a metric on a dashboard; it is the difference between a 70B model fitting on a phone and not fitting. A 3× speedup from speculative decoding is not a benchmark; it is the difference between an assistant that responds conversationally and one that feels broken. A 4× throughput improvement from INT4 quantization is not a paper result; it is the difference between an API that costs $30/M tokens and one that costs $3/M tokens — the difference between a feature only Fortune-500 companies can afford and a feature a high-school student can build on. **The line from a roofline diagram to a consumer experience is short and direct.** This is the rarest and most valuable property a technical discipline can have: that the math and the user experience are the same conversation, just with different vocabulary.

Think about what this means for the next few years. The techniques in this book compound. GQA × FP8 × FlashAttention × PagedAttention × speculative decoding × continuous batching stacks to somewhere between 100× and 1000× more useful work per GPU-hour than a naive implementation. That compounding is what has taken the per-token price of a frontier LLM down by two orders of magnitude since 2023 and what will take it down another order by 2028. Every additional order of magnitude opens new product categories that were previously uneconomical — real-time voice agents, embodied robotics with LLM reasoning in the loop, fully personalized tutors running on-device, million-token context windows over your private documents. You are now equipped to build any of these.

There is also a quieter version of this beauty that I want to name. Inference engineering is one of the few places in modern software where *you get to see the whole stack at once*. You cannot optimize a speculative-decoding scheduler without understanding the attention kernel. You cannot pick the right quantization format without knowing which tensor cores your GPU has. You cannot deploy disaggregated prefill without understanding NVLink topology. This discipline forces you to hold the hardware and the algorithm and the product experience in your head simultaneously, and that full-stack thinking is increasingly rare. It is also increasingly valuable.

As you leave this book, a few pieces of parting advice from the three of us.

**Measure before you optimize.** Every technique in here has a regime where it helps and a regime where it hurts. FlashAttention wins at long context; quantization wins when weight-loading dominates; speculative decoding wins when outputs are predictable. Run the benchmark on *your* workload before you adopt anything.

**Read the primary sources.** Every chapter in this book points to foundational papers — Dao et al. on FlashAttention, Kwon et al. on PagedAttention, Leviathan et al. on speculation, Frantar et al. on GPTQ, Gu and Dao on Mamba. Read them. The chapters here compress the ideas; the papers give you the full derivations and the knobs the authors tuned.

**Stay close to the hardware.** The fastest inference engineers we know can name the HBM bandwidth, tensor-core TFLOPS, and NVLink rate of the GPU they are currently deploying on, from memory. Knowing these three numbers lets you predict whether an optimization will help you before you write a line of code.

**Build things people can feel.** The ultimate test of an inference improvement is not whether it looks good on a roofline plot. It is whether the user experience becomes noticeably better. Faster first token. Smoother streaming. Cheaper API calls. Longer context windows. More responsive agents. Those are the rewards, and they are what makes the months you might spend on a single kernel worth it.

And finally — **this field is moving fast, and it is moving faster every year.** What looked like the state of the art in 2024 is a baseline in 2026. What looks like frontier work in 2026 will be a baseline in 2028. The specific techniques in this book will be improved, replaced, or combined in ways we cannot predict. But the *way of thinking* — five numbers, one roofline, one physical constraint at a time — will outlast any specific algorithm. That is what we hope you carry forward.

We hope you have understood, at the end of all this, why we three chose to teach this material together. Inference engineering is mathematically rigorous, physically grounded, deeply intuitive, and directly felt by the end user. It is rare for a technical discipline to be all four of those things at once. When it is, it deserves a book.

Thank you for reading.
